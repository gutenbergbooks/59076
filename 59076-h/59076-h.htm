is now twenty Years since your Lordship's
Appointment to the Head of his Majesty's
Hunting Establishment, during which it has acquired
a Degree of Perfection and Celebrity,
hitherto unprecedented in the Annals of Sporting
History. From the impressive Influence of your
Lordship's philanthropic Representations, every
Subordinate within the utmost Limits of your
Lordship's Department, has derived an annual
Addition, by which the domestic Comforts of his
Family have been most happily encreased. The
Hospitalities of Swinley Lodge<span

are universally
known, and at all Times gratefully recollected,
by that Infinity of Sportsmen who have so repeatedly
experienced their salutary Effects.</p>

<p>To have had the inexpressible Happiness of partaking
with your Lordship the Pleasures of the
Chase during the Whole of that Period; to have
witnessed your Lordship's humane, polite, and
condescending Attention to various Individuals,
upon the most distressing Emergencies; to have
been repeatedly honoured by your Lordship's
public Patronage and private Favor; are Gratifications
of so much Magnitude to the Ambition of a
Sportsman, that it is impossible to resist the
Temptation of dedicating to your Lordship, a
Work solely appertaining to the <span class="smcap">Sports</span> of the

<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smcap" style="font-size:150%">The</span>
variety of Publications annually announced
under <span class="smcap lowercase">SPORTING TITLES</span>, with which
the contents, upon examination, are found so
ill to accord, first suggested to the Writer, the
idea of forming an aggregate of information,
from whence both entertainment and instruction
(to the young and inexperienced) might
be derived. From a review of the works now
extant, under titles nearly similar, it was
found they were the productions of more than
a century past. These having been repeatedly
re-copied, and repeatedly transmitted from
one generation to another, are replete with
matter nearly <i>obsolete</i>, and sports long since
<span class="pagenum">{viii}</span>
<i>buried in oblivion</i>. From these facts may be
inferred, the very trifling utility such books are
of in the improved sports and refined polish of
the present time; more particularly when one
just and emphatic remark from the pen of a
most popular writer is adverted to, that there
is no subject upon which so little has been judiciously
written, as upon the <span class="smcap lowercase">SPORTS</span> of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">FIELD</span>; and what has issued from the press
under titles of attracting similitude, have been
much more the efforts of theoretic lucubration,
than the result of practical knowledge, or personal
experience.</p>

<p>To compensate for such deficiency, is the
professed purport of the present Work; calculated
to recommend itself to public attention
upon no other ground than its originality, and
the great variety of useful information it will
be found to comprehend. Numerous and diversified
<span class="pagenum">{ix}</span>
as the subjects are, they will be found
largely treated on, and satisfactorily explained:
not as has been too much the case in former
publications, by the effusions of <i>literary fertility</i>,
but clearly demonstrated upon the practical
knowledge, and individual experience,
of the <span class="smcap">Author</span>; who, disdaining the subservient
<i>trammels</i> of <i>imitation</i>, has not presumed
to enter into a diffuse disquisition upon any
<span class="smcap lowercase">SPORT</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">SUBJECT</span> in which he has not been
personally and principally engaged. If the
mind of man can be candidly admitted to derive
some gratification from its universality of
rational attainment, so it is the greatest and
most consolatory ambition of his life, to have
engaged in every sport, and to have embarked
in every pleasure, upon which these Volumes
will be found to treat; without a deviation
from the line of consistency, a debasement of
dignity, or a degradation of character.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{x}</div>

<p>It is a long standing and universally acknowledged
axiom, that the art of life consists
as much in knowing what to avoid, as
what to pursue; and this cannot apply with
more force or propriety, than to those who
throw themselves unthinkingly upon the fascinating
prospects, and <i>uncertain chances</i>, of
the <span class="smcap lowercase">SPORTING WORLD</span>; the necessitous and
determined dependents upon which are replete
with numerous barbed and unerring instruments
of depredation. To juvenile adventurers,
who feel themselves inadequate to the
talk of self-denial, and who cannot resist the
predominant temptation of engaging in scenes
of such <i>duplicity</i> and <i>danger</i>, is earnestly recommended
an occasional reference to those
heads in the following Work, which are fully
fraught with precautions they may probably
stand much in need of; amongst these,
<span class="smcap lowercase">BETTING</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">COCKING</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">GAMING</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">HAZARD</span>, and
<span class="pagenum">{xi}</span>
the <span class="smcap lowercase">TURF</span>,
will not be found the least conspicuous;
the delineations of which are taken
with so much accuracy, that the most <i>tenacious</i>
professor of <i>the arts</i> cannot feel himself materially
affected by the correctness of the description.</p>

<p>Professed <span class="smcap lowercase">SPORTSMEN</span> of every other description
will find no unfair restraint laid upon
their distinct or separate inquiries, or investigations.
The <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSE</span> will be found very fully
expatiated upon in all its <i>states</i> and <i>stages</i>, as
well in <span class="smcap lowercase">SICKNESS</span> as in
<span class="smcap lowercase">HEALTH</span>.
The <span class="smcap lowercase">CHASE</span>,
of every particular kind, will be found to have
undergone the most minute description; and
its numerous appendages proportionally explained.
The existing <span class="smcap lowercase">GAME LAWS</span> are simplified,
and reduced to one comprehensive
<i>single</i> point of view. <span class="smcap">Lovers</span>
of the <span class="smcap lowercase">TURF</span>
will find themselves gratified with a recital of
<span class="pagenum">{xii}</span>
its past and present state; as well as with a
correct account of the recent racing performances
of some of the most celebrated horses of
the present time. That there will be discovered
some traits not perfectly pleasing to every individual
must be presumed; but as they are not
written by the pen of prostitution, no apology
can be necessary for the unavoidable introduction
of <span class="smcap lowercase">TRUTH</span>, particularly under the scholastic
retrospection of</p>

<p class="indent2">"Vain his attempt who strives to please ye all."</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3><span class="smcap" style="font-size:150%">Authors</span></h3><p>,—who
have dedicated much time and
labour to the infinity of subjects which these Volumes
will contain, have been both numerous and
respectable; and to those who are accustomed to
see things through a single medium, it will seem
matter of surprise, that any thing <span class="smcap lowercase">NEW</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">INSTRUCTIVE</span>,
or <span class="smcap lowercase">ENTERTAINING</span>, should be still left worthy
of public attention; but when the unceasing influence,
and decisive dictates of fashion; the abolition
of old sports, and introduction of new; the
various regulations in, and increase of, the penal
laws for the preservation of <span class="smcap lowercase">GAME</span>,
and the privileges
of <i>killing</i>; in addition to the great and unprecedented
national exertion in the reformation of <span class="smcap lowercase">FARRIERY</span>,
<span class="pagenum">{2}</span>
since the publication of the present Author's
<span class="smcap">Stable Directory</span>, are taken into the aggregate; it
will be found, by the judicious and enlightened
part of the <span class="smcap lowercase">SPORTING WORLD</span>, that a more modern,
comprehensive, and explanatory work, has not been
<i>too soon</i> obtruded upon <span class="smcap lowercase">PUBLIC PATRONAGE</span>.
To enumerate individually here, those Authors, of
the greatest celebrity, whose endeavours or productions
have stood the highest in general estimation,
would prove not only unnecessary, but superfluous,
as they will of course be occasionally adverted to,
and remarked upon, under different heads in the progress
of the Work.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>ARTISTS</h3><p>—are gentlemen, the aid of whose
pencils, in the decorative department of sporting
publications, is considered so immediately necessary
(particularly with the younger branches) in all
matters of minutiæ requiring accurate representation,
that the success is frequently considered doubtful
and uncertain without the attractive influence of
their professional exertions. It has been observed,
and must be freely admitted, that, till within the
last third of the last century, <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSES</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">DOGS</span>, and
<span class="smcap lowercase">GAME</span>, have appeared less upon canvas (in proportion
to the progress of the art) than any subjects
whatever: whether they were thought less worthy
the study and pencil of the master, or productive
of less emolument, it may not be possible, nor is it
much to the purpose, to ascertain. Certain it is,
<span class="pagenum">{3}</span>
they have never, at any former period, so nearly approached
the summit of perfection as at the present
moment; never were artists known more emulous;
never were finer pictures produced by the foreign
pencils of fertility, than are now exhibited by the
natives of our own island; nor ever were artists of
this description so largely patronized, or so well
rewarded.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Elmer</span>, whose paintings of
<span class="smcap lowercase">GAME</span> excited the
astonishment and admiration of every beholder for
forty years past, has lately paid his last debt, with
one of the best and most unsullied characters that
ever accompanied man to the grave: but what is
equally to be regretted, is the total destruction and
loss of his very valuable collection (soon after his
death) by an accidental fire near the Haymarket,
where they had been but lately deposited and arranged
for exhibition; constituting an irreparable
misfortune to those whose property they were become
by his decease, and no small disappointment
to <span class="smcap lowercase">CONNOISSEURS</span>, amongst whom they would most
probably have been divided at some future period
by public sale.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap lowercase">PROFESSIONAL ARTISTS</span>, or, as they are
now more familiarly termed, <i>animal painters</i>, who
derive present advantage from public protection
and personal popularity, are not numerous, but
truly respectable; each enjoying the happy effect of
<span class="pagenum">{4}</span>
his own peculiar excellence, in the gradations of favour,
a discriminating and indulgent public is always
so truly ready to bestow. Of these, the names
of <span class="smcap">Stubbs</span>, <span class="smcap">Gilpin</span>,
<span class="smcap">Marshall</span>, <span class="smcap">Garrard</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Sartorius</span>, appear the most prominent. Others
there are, but of much inferior note, who do not
at present promise (by the specimens they have displayed)
to soar above the planetary influence of
mediocrity. Various productions of the rest of
those just mentioned, have for years in succession
graced the exhibition of the <span class="smcap">Royal Academy</span> at
<span class="smcap">Somerset House</span>, where they have been as repeatedly
honoured with <span class="smcap lowercase">ROYAL</span> as with general approbation:
but whether it is owing to a superiority of
good fortune, or to a superiority of his genius,
<span class="smcap">Marshall</span> is the only instance of an artist's having
so early in life, and with so much rapidity, reached
the summit of princely patronage, as well as the
very zenith of professional celebrity, without having
once submitted a single production of his pencil to
the caprice of public opinion at the shrine of fashion,
hitherto considered the only possible and direct
road to <span class="smcap">Fame</span> and <span class="smcap">Fortune</span>.</p>

<h3>ABSCESS</h3><p>.—An abscess (in either man or beast)
is an inflammatory tumour, constituting a progressive
formation of matter from some serious injury
<i>previously</i> received by blow, bruise, or accident.
It may also proceed from plethora, or gross humours
originating in a too viscid (or acrimonious)
<span class="pagenum">{5}</span>
state of the blood; as well as a morbid disposition
of the fluids; and many degrees of latent ill usage,
to which <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSES</span> are incessantly subject, from the
too well-known and irremediable inhumanity of the
lower classes, to whose superintendence and management
they are unavoidably, and must inevitably,
continue to be entrusted. From whatever cause an
abscess may proceed, judicious discrimination should
be expected and enjoined from the practitioners employed;
many of whom (particularly of the old
school) possess, and indulge in, the unhappy fatality
of endeavouring to counteract Nature, and to set
all her powerful efforts at defiance. Under this mistaken
notion of <i>scientific practice</i>, in such and similar
cases, great difficulties frequently arise; not more in
respect to the very evident ill effect of erroneous
treatment, but in the disappointment occasioned
by a procrastination of cure.</p>

</div>

<p>The very basis and foundation of an abscess being
a cavity continually enlarging internally by the
propulsive force of matter collecting within, will
sufficiently demonstrate the inconsiderate folly,
and extreme obstinacy, of endeavouring to repel,
by the interposing and improper power of spirituous
repellents, or saturnine astringents, what Nature is
making her most strenuous efforts to discharge. In
all slight and superficial appearances of tumefaction,
where there are no immediate or strong signs of suppuration,
the use of moderate repellents may be
<span class="pagenum">{6}</span>
adopted with judgment, and in most cases with success;
but when the predominant, and almost invariable,
symptoms of increased swelling, great
heat, with pricking and darting sensations, (in the
human frame,) or visible increase of the enlargement,
and palpable pain upon pressure, in the <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSE</span>,
denote the formation of matter to be going on, all
attempts at repulsion must be instantly laid aside; not
only as nugatory, but as tending to mischief in the
extreme. Such treatment persevered in, would evidently
not only retard, but positively <i>destroy</i>, every
chance of ultimately effecting a purpose, for which
alone the experiment could have been made. The
consequence would soon prove decisive, by a termination
in either an indurated tumour, a fixed schirrus,
a partial and imperfect suppuration, a fistulous
wound, or an inveterate and ill-conditioned ulcer.
As, however, it is not intended to extend the Work
to a complete system of <span class="smcap lowercase">ANATOMY</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">SURGERY</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">PHYSIC</span>,
or <span class="smcap lowercase">FARRIERY</span>, but to render its utility more general
and diffusive, reference must be occasionally and
necessarily made to the professors of either, or to
the books particularly appropriated to the subject
of each.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>ACADEMY</h3><p>,—which for time immemorial has
been in use to signify a seminary for youth only,
has at length acquired, by the refinement of <i>fashion</i>,
the honour of giving more dignity to what has hitherto
passed under the denomination of <span class="smcap lowercase">A RIDING</span>
<span class="pagenum">{7}</span>
<span class="smcap lowercase">SCHOOL</span>; now transformed, by the sublimity of
the superior classes, into an "<span class="smcap lowercase">EQUESTRIAN ACADEMY</span>;"
of which more will be found under the
proper and distinct heads of <span class="smcap">Manege</span> and
<span class="smcap">Riding School</span>.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>ACCLOYED</h3><p>—is almost obsolete, and will be
buried in oblivion with the last <span class="smcap lowercase">FARRIER</span> of the <i>old
school</i>. It has been formerly used to signify an injury
sustained in the foot by shoeing; as when a nail
had swerved from its proper direction, and punctured
(or pressed too close upon) the membranous mass
so as to occasion lameness, the horse was then said
to be "accloyed:" but no well-founded derivation
is to be discovered for a term of so much
ambiguity.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>ACHE</h3><p>;—pain arising from different causes, originating
in blows, wounds, inflammations, and colds;
as for instance, the <span class="smcap lowercase">CHRONIC RHEUMATISM</span>, which
may be termed a <span class="smcap lowercase">CONTINUAL ACHE</span>.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>ACRIMONY</h3><p>—is a state of the blood disposed
to only <i>certain</i> degrees of disease, by the quantity of
serum becoming too great for the proportion of
crassamentum, with which, in its state of <i>active fluidity</i>,
it is combined for the purpose of regular circulation,
so invariably necessary to the standard of
health. <span class="smcap">Blood</span> thus divested of its adhesive property,
soon displays in <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSES</span> a tendency to what are
<span class="pagenum">{8}</span>
termed <i>acrimonious</i> diseases, originating in, and
dependent upon, the impoverished state to which it
is reduced. Hence arises a train of trouble and
disquietude more vexatious than alarming, more
troublesome than expensive; as <i>cracked heels</i>; <i>cutaneous
eruptions</i> of the <i>dry</i> and <i>scurfy</i> kind; a dingy,
variegated, <i>unhealthy</i> hue of the <i>coat</i>; and frequently
a seemingly <i>half starved</i> contraction of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">CREST</span>.
These palpable effects of acrimony in the blood,
are produced much more by the penury and indifference
of the master, (or the <i>neglect</i> of his servant,)
than any disposition to disease in the horse.
Experience has sufficiently proved, that a sufficient
quantity of proper and healthy food is so indispensably
requisite for the support of the frame, and
every office of the animal œconomy, that a want
of such due supply must be productive of acrimony
in a greater or a less degree; to obtund which, and
counteract its effects, recourse must be had to alimentary
invigorants and antimonial alteratives, as
will be found more medically explained in "<i>The
Gentleman's Stable Directory</i>;" or, "<i>Taplin's Compendium
of Farriery</i>."</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>ACTION</h3><p>—is a word in constant use with the
<span class="smcap lowercase">SPORTING</span> world, and horse-dealing fraternity, to
express the peculiar property of a horse by his <i>good</i>
or <i>bad</i> action: speaking of him as a subject possessing
superior powers, he is called "a horse of exceeding
fine action;" meaning it to be understood, he is
<span class="pagenum">{9}</span>
not to be found fault with; that he is calculated to
make a very valuable roadster, "as he trots within
himself (that is, with ease to himself) <i>fourteen</i> or
<i>fifteen</i> miles an <i>hour</i>;" implying an unequivocal
proof of his speed in that pace: that he goes in <i>high</i>
style, "well above his ground;" meaning, that he
lifts his legs light, quick, and freely, without
dwelling or <i>tripping</i>, so as to be entitled to the degrading
appellation of "a daisy cutter," by going
too near, and of course always liable to fall.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>ADDER STUNG</h3><p>,—a term indiscriminately applied
to the bites or stings of venomous animals and
insects without distinction; and this probably arose
from the frequent discovery of such accidents,
without being able to ascertain the cause, or from
what enemy the injury was sustained. <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSES</span>, as
well as <span class="smcap lowercase">DOGS</span>,
are sometimes bit by the <span class="smcap lowercase">VIPER</span>,
(called <i>an adder</i>,) slow-worm, or eft; but much
more frequently stung by hornets, wasps; a large
gold-coloured, long-bodied, glittering fly, called,
"a horse-stinger;" or other poisonous insects, with
which, in the summer months, the sunny banks of
pastures so infinitely abound. In all injuries of this
kind, bleeding (pretty freely in respect to quantity)
should precede every other consideration; as instantly
unloading the vessels must greatly contribute
to the intent of reducing present and preventing
farther inflammation. For some generations, unctuous
and oily applications have been in general
<span class="pagenum">{10}</span>
use, without any well-founded reason, or established
proof, of their being either infallible or efficacious;
but in the present and enlightened state of much-improved
practice, frequent fomentations of warm
vinegar, an aqueous solution of sal. armoniac, or
the vegeto mineral water of a pretty strong consistence,
may be safely and advantageously preferred;
assisting the general effort with small doses
of <i>nitre</i> and <i>gum arabic</i>, to allay inflammation, and
attenuate the blood.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>ADULTERATION</h3><p>—is the too prevalent custom
of lowering the strength of spirits by the profitable
addition of water, thereby reducing the quality
by increasing the quantity; or, in words of less paradoxical
import, by a most deceptive prostitution of
integrity on one side, and an equally shameful imposition
upon friendly confidence on the other.
This species of lawless tergiversation, bad as it is,
cannot be considered so truly unprincipled, so
strictly iniquitous, or so cruelly destructive, as the
adulteration of medicine: this has been for a long
time past the <i>purest privilege</i> of the profession, and
may be candidly concluded the most predominant
and best-founded reason that can be assigned for the
unprecedented increase of <span class="smcap lowercase">CHEMISTS</span>
and <span class="smcap lowercase">DRUGGISTS</span>
in every part of the kingdom. The superior art of
adulteration consists (with the adept) in so securely
incorporating the cheap and inferior substitute with
the genuine and higher priced article of the Materia
<span class="pagenum">{11}</span>
Medica, as to insure the additional profit, and
(secundum artem) escape detection. To this <i>purity</i>
of principle, this species of professional privilege,
it is, that individuals of opulence and liberality
stand indebted for the disappointments they have
experienced in the expected efficacy of "prescriptions
<i>faithfully</i> prepared."</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>AGE</h3><p>.—The age is generally a leading question
respecting any horse offered for sale; and this is at
all times to be ascertained with more certainty by
the state of the <span class="smcap lowercase">TEETH</span>
than any other means whatever;
unless he has undergone the <i>secret</i> operation
of a <span class="smcap lowercase">DEALER</span>,
known by the appellation of "<i>bishoping</i>,"
which will be found described under that
head.</p>

</div>

<p>When a horse is more than six years old, he is
then termed an <i>aged</i> horse; from which time till
<i>seven</i>, the cavities in his teeth fill up; and from
<i>seven</i> to <i>eight</i> years old, (varying a little in different
subjects,) the mark is entirely obliterated, by which
his age can no longer be perfectly known. Deprived
of this criterion, general observations must
be resorted to, upon which only a tolerable (though
sometimes an uncertain) opinion may be formed.
If the teeth are very long and discoloured, ragged
at the edges, with either the upper or lower projecting
beyond the other; the fleshy ridges (called
bars) of the upper jaw become smooth and contracted;
<span class="pagenum">{12}</span>
the tongue lean and wrinkled at the sides;
the eyes receding from their former prominence,
and a hollow and ghastly indentation above the
orb; the knees projecting beyond the shank-bone,
and overhanging the fetlock, as well as a knuckling
or bending forward of the lower joints behind;
little time need be lost in looking for farther proofs;
old age is approaching very fast. For age by the
teeth, see <span class="smcap">Colt</span>.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>AGUE</h3><p>,—a fever of the intermittent kind, which
was for many years a matter of doubt and controversy,
whether fevers of this description existed in
the horse, or merely in the <i>brain</i> of the <span class="smcap lowercase">FARRIER</span>;
when, after long investigation, strict attention, and
steady observation, by practitioners of the first eminence,
the point is at length acceded to; and it is
admitted that <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSES</span> are subject to, and attacked
with, <span class="smcap lowercase">INTERMITTENTS</span>, bearing an affinity to the
<i>quotidians</i>, <i>tertians</i>, and <i>quartans</i>, of the human
species.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>ÆGYPTIACUM</h3><p>—is a well known and long established
external application in veterinary practice,
and is thus prepared.</p>

</div>

<p>Take of verdigrease, finely powdered, five ounces;
honey, fourteen ounces; the best white wine
vinegar, seven ounces; mix and boil them over a
gentle fire to the consistence of treacle or honey.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{13}</div>

<p>This article, which has so long passed under the
denomination of an ointment, and was so called in
the London Dispensatory of the College of Physicians,
produces, without any additional process,
(but merely by standing, and depositing its sediment,)
<i>another</i> name for a <i>part</i> of the <i>same</i> preparation
in this way: the grosser parts subsiding, constitute
a more substantial consistence at the <i>bottom</i>,
which is the article termed <span class="smcap lowercase">ÆGYPTIACUM</span>: the fluid
or thinner part, floating upon the surface, is the
mildest in its effect, and called, by medicinal practitioners,
<span class="smcap lowercase">MEL ÆGYPTIACUM</span>. The property of both
(one being a degree stronger than the other, and
may be used separately, or shaken together, according
to the effect required) is to assist in cleansing
inveterate and long-standing ulcers; to keep down
fungous flesh; and to promote the sloughing off of
such foul and unhealthy parts of the surface, as
prevent new granulations from arising to constitute
the incarnation necessary to a sound and permanent
restoration of parts. They are articles of acknowledged
utility in the hands of judicious and experienced
practitioners; but the furor of folly has
sometimes rendered them <i>medicines of mischief</i> with
those who have never heard, or do not condescend
to recollect, the trite but expressive adage, that
"the shoemaker should never go beyond his last."
This is the case when the lower classes of <i>farriers</i>,
<i>smiths</i>, <i>coachmen</i>, and <i>grooms</i>, attempt to cure the
grease, cracked heels, &amp;c. with the articles described,
<span class="pagenum">{14}</span>
constituting to a certainty, "the <i>remedy</i>
worse than the <i>disease</i>."</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>AIR</h3><p>—is the element in which we breathe; a
floating (or fluctuating) fluid, with which we are
imperceptibly surrounded, and by whose elastic
property we are enabled to exist. A philosophic
enquiry into, or definition of, the very air itself,
is not to the purpose here; nor, indeed, without a
demonstrative and practical apparatus, can its wonderful
properties be perfectly understood.</p>

</div>

<p>Its various effects upon both the body and the
mind of man, as well in sickness as in health, cannot
be lost even upon the least sensible and least
ruminative observer; who is in the constant enjoyment
of those great blessings, <i>air</i>, <i>health</i>, and
<i>exercise</i>; for he finds himself affected (and frequently
like <span class="smcap">Pope's</span> rustic hero, who "whistled as
he went for want of thought") in different ways,
and by every breeze, without knowing <i>why</i>: he
<i>meltingly</i> submits one day to the <span class="smcap lowercase">SUN</span>; he <i>shrinks</i>
another from the cold: he is depressed, even to
melancholy, with the heavy gloom and dense atmosphere
<i>to day</i>; and elated, almost beyond the
power of expression, by the exhilarating, temperate,
clear and lucid sky of <i>to-morrow</i>. If then the spirits
are thus not only fairly considered, but fully
proved, the thermometer of mental sensations, upon
which the air (or rather its change) is found to
<span class="pagenum">{15}</span>
operate with so much palpable effect; who shall
presume to doubt its physical influence upon the
human frame, so far as is applicable to the introduction
of disease, or the re-establishment of health?</p>

<p>Thus much it has been unavoidably necessary to
introduce by way of proof, that the human frame
being so affected by the extremes of <i>heat</i> and <i>cold</i>,
<i>damps</i> or <i>dryness</i>, such proportional effects (though
not probably in directly the same way) may be produced
by the same means upon the <span class="smcap lowercase">ANIMAL</span> world,
who possessing no power of communication, we
cannot derive information but by means of observation
upon the <i>original</i> cause and <i>relative</i> effect. As
for instance; if the air is too much impregnated
with cold, moist, damp particles between the chilling
showers of hazy weather, the body (particularly
of invalids and valetudinarians) is much more disposed
to, and susceptible of, morbidity, than in a
more temperate and settled state of the atmosphere.
This, proceeding from a collapsion of the porous
system, occasions slight indisposition with thousands,
who are sensibly affected by lassitude and disquietude,
not reaching disease; whilst in others more
irritable, it is soon productive of coughs, sore
throats, fevers, inflammations of the lungs, and
various other disorders. North winds are considered
bracing, healthy, and invigorating, to good,
sound constitutions; though they are always complained
of by those of delicate and tender habits;
<span class="pagenum">{16}</span>
and there can be no difference of opinion upon the
fact, that dry seasons are more conducive to health
and spirits than those of a contrary description.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>AIR</h3><p>,—a technical term in the <span class="smcap lowercase">MANEGE</span>,
which can be but little explained in theory; a perfect knowledge
of these terms can only be acquired in the
practice of the schools.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>AIRING</h3><p>;—the taking of horses from the stable
to the enjoyment of <span class="smcap lowercase">AIR</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">EXERCISE</span>.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>ALE</h3><p>,—the good old healthy English beverage,
brewed from malt, hops and water, <i>alone</i>, with no
intoxicating or deleterious articles of adulteration.
It is an excellent extemporaneous substitute for
<i>gruel</i>, in cases of emergency with horses, where it
is required as a vehicle in which to dissolve and administer
medicine to prevent delay, as in <i>cholic</i>,
<i>strangury</i>, &amp;c.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>ALOES</h3><p>—is a resinous gum, extracted from the
tree whose name it bears, and is brought to us
chiefly from the island of Barbadoes. The shops
produce two sorts, called <span class="smcap">Succotrine</span> and
<span class="smcap">Barbadoes</span>;
the former of which is the <i>mildest</i>; but the
latter most in use, to insure the certainty of operation.
It is the principal ingredient in purging balls for horses.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>ALTERATIVES</h3><p>.—Medicines are so called
which constitute an effect upon the system, or an
<span class="pagenum">{17}</span>
alteration in the <i>property</i> of the <i>blood</i>, without any
sensible internal or visible external operation.
Upon their introduction to the stomach, they become
incorporated with its contents; and their
medical properties being taken up by the chyle, is
conveyed through the lymphatics to the blood-vessels,
where it becomes a part of the blood itself,
which being fully impregnated with the neutralizing
property of the article administered as an alterative,
possesses the power of obtunding acrimony,
and restraining tendency to disease.</p>

</div>

<p>Of all the classes of medicines, none can be more
proper or applicable than alteratives, to those who
cannot make it convenient to let their horses undergo
a regular routine of purgation at the accustomed
seasons; as during the administration of alteratives
(mercurials excepted) a horse may go
through the same occasional work, and diurnal discipline,
as if he was under no course of medicine
whatever. The alteratives most deservedly esteemed,
are antimony, sulphur, nitre, (in small quantities,)
cream of tartar, Æthiops mineral, and the
antimonial alterative powders of the Author, to be
found in the list of his medicines at the conclusion
of the Work.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>ALUM</h3><p>—is an article too well known in the
shops, to require farther description, than its medical
utility, when, upon any emergency, it may be
<span class="pagenum">{18}</span>
advantageously brought into use. Reduced to fine
powder, and applied as a <i>styptic</i> to the mouths of
divided vessels, to stop the effusion of blood, it
will be found very efficacious. Dissolved in water,
the proportion of <i>one ounce</i> to a <i>pint</i>, it is an infallible
cure for the foul white specks, or little watery
pustules, so frequently seen in the mouths of
horses, (and supposed to arise from internal heat,)
the parts being twice or thrice touched with a piece
of fine sponge, properly moistened with the solution.
Burnt alum, finely powdered, and sprinkled, very
lightly, upon the fungous flesh of old or foul
wounds, will speedily reduce it, and promote the
cure.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>ALIMENT</h3><p>—has, in general acceptation, been
received as a word strictly synonimous with food;
and, like that term, been intended to imply support
of any kind, in either a <i>solid</i> or a <i>liquid</i> form.
One of the publications with which the press so
frequently teems, from the fertile pens of juvenile
veterinarians, says, "By <span class="smcap lowercase">ALIMENT</span>, some understand
only the <i>nutricious part</i> of the food; but this
is a nice and useless distinction. <span class="smcap">Mr. Taplin</span> uses
the word <i>aliment</i> in both senses."</p>

</div>

<p>To set this upon better ground, for the comprehension
of all matters relative to bodily sustenance,
the animal œconomy, its natural secretions and
evacuations, it is necessary a criterion should be
<span class="pagenum">{19}</span>
fixed, by which its intentional meaning should be
generally understood. It has been hitherto used
in the previous Works of the present Author, not
as synonimous with either <span class="smcap lowercase">FOOD</span> or <span class="smcap lowercase">NUTRIMENT</span>,
but in a sense directly <i>between both</i>, and for this
reason. Food may feed a frame, and prolong
existence; though, from its weak, improper, or impoverished
quality, it may not possess the essential
property requisite to generate blood, create flesh,
or promote strength.</p>

<p>The word <span class="smcap lowercase">ALIMENT</span> seems intended to convey an
idea somewhat <i>superior</i> to the meaning expressed
in the term <i>food</i>, and yet not extend so far as the
mind may lead us, in the comprehensive view of
the word <span class="smcap lowercase">NUTRIMENT</span>; for, although mouldy hay,
or musty straw, may be taken by an animal, in a
state of hunger and necessity, to support life, it
does not follow that from <i>such food</i> a proper portion
of nutriment can be conveyed to the frame. <span class="smcap">Aliment</span>,
therefore, upon every occasion, in which it
will be found necessary to introduce it during the
course of this Work, must be considered as a term
intended to convey an idea of support (in any way
whatever) adequate to health, and a state of useful
service; in the direct line of mediocrity between
the <i>starving existence</i> of a "winter straw yard,"
near the metropolis, and the nutritious and invigorating
system necessary for the invalid recovering
from a state of emaciation, or the severity of disease.</p>

<h3>AMBLE</h3><p>,—the pace in a horse, almost peculiar
to country people, with poneys and galloways bred

little use with any other part of the world.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>AMBURY, or <i>Anbury</i></h3><p>,—is a complicated excrescence,
bearing the appearance of a <i>warty</i> wen.
Various have been the modes of cure; to prevent
an unnecessary enumeration of which, will be to
observe, that they may be safely extirpated, and
completely cured, by carefully moistening the surface,
once in every three or four days, with the <i>butter</i>
of <i>antimony</i>, till they are obliterated; and this
will certainly be effected, whatever may be their
size or magnitude.</p>

<h3>AMPHITHEATRE</h3><p>—is an elegant and commodious
structure, either circular or oblong, for
the display of feats of horsemanship, poney races,
fox hunts, and the exhibition of pantomimes.
<span class="smcap">Mr. Astley</span>'s, near Westminster Bridge, has for
many years been a favourite resort with the public;
but he now finds a powerful rival in the <span class="smcap">Circus</span>.
Mr. Astley's skill in the military art of <i>attack</i> and
<i>defence</i>, as well as his superior style of teaching in
<span class="pagenum">{21}</span>
the <span class="smcap lowercase">MANEGE</span>, have jointly increased his reputation,

<div class="combine">

<h3>ANATOMY</h3><p>,—the study and knowledge of the
structure of the human frame in all its component
parts; an accurate knowledge of which can only
lead the practitioner in surgery to the most distant
hope of eminence in his profession, or celebrity in
his practice. A proficiency in the anatomical formation
of the horse, is every way as necessary to the
success of the veterinarian, as the utmost efforts of

<div class="combine">

<h3>ANGLING</h3><p>—is the art of catching fish by rods
and lines, of different construction, with baits, <i>natural</i>
and <i>artificial</i>, according to the season of the
year, and the fish intended to be caught. As this
<i>sport</i> (if it may with consistency be termed one) is
not very eagerly sought, and enjoyed but by <i>few</i>,
it will not be much enlarged on here; more particularly
as those who enter into the minutiæ of
enquiry, and <i>spirit</i> of the <i>practice</i>, will find whole
volumes appropriate to this particular purpose. A
writer of no small celebrity, in alluding to this
subject, says, "<span class="smcap lowercase">FISHING</span>
is but a <i>dull</i> diversion,
and, in my opinion, calculated only to teach <i>patience</i>
to a <span class="smcap lowercase">PHILOSOPHER</span>;" and this most likely is
the echoed opinion of every <i>fox-hunter</i> in the kingdom;
for it should seem that the simple sameness
<span class="pagenum">{22}</span>
of <i>angling</i>, and the more noble, healthy and exhilarating
sports of <span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTING</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">SHOOTING</span>, were,
in a certain degree, <i>heterogeneous</i>, as it has been
but very rarely or ever known, that the enthusiastic
admirers of <i>one</i> were ever warm or anxious followers
of the <i>other</i>.</p>

<p>The kinds of fish which mostly attract the attention
of anglers in the principal fresh water rivers
and trout streams of the kingdom, (whether for the
sport of killing, or the supply of the table,) are
<i>salmon</i>, <i>trout</i>, <i>pike</i>, <i>barbel</i>, <i>chub</i>,
<i>perch</i>, <i>roach</i>,
<i>dace</i>, and <i>gudgeon</i>: <span class="smcap lowercase">CARP</span>
and <span class="smcap lowercase">TENCH</span> may also be
taken into the aggregate, upon the score of <i>attraction</i>;
but instances are few where any great quantity
has been taken in this way, as they are, in
general, particularly in ponds, motes, and still
waters, too shy and cautious to become the hasty
victims of human invention.</p>

<p>Upon the subject of <span class="smcap lowercase">ANGLING</span>,
it may not be inapplicable
to term it a most <i>unfortunate</i> attachment
with those classes of society who have no property
but their <i>trades</i>, and to whom <i>time</i> alone must be
considered a kind of freehold estate: such time lost
by a river side, in the frivolous and uncertain pursuit
of a paltry plate of fish, instead of being employed
in business, has reduced more men <i>to want</i>,
and their families to <i>a workhouse</i>, than any species
of sport whatever. Racing, hunting, shooting,
<span class="pagenum">{23}</span>
coursing, and cocking, (destructive as the latter has
been,) have never produced so long a list of <i>beggars</i>
as the sublime <i>art of angling</i>; in confirmation
of which fact, the eye of observation need only
turn to any of those small country towns near
which there happens to run a <i>fishing stream</i>, when
the profitable part of the pleasure may be instantly
perceived by the poverty of the inhabitants.</p>

<h3>ANISEEDS</h3><p>—are the produce of a plant cultivated
much more in France, Spain, and Germany,
than in any part of England. Those from Spain
are preferred; they have a fragrant smell, a warm
pleasant taste, with some degree of sweetness.
When reduced to powder, they form a principal
and efficacious ingredient in the preparation of the
pectoral cordial balls for horses, where their virtues
are fully admitted. They yield, by expression, an
aromatic essential oil, containing all the medical
property of the seeds, and is mostly imported to us
from other parts ready prepared. Being an article
of some expence, it is very much adulterated with
sperma-cæti, and other articles, for the profitable
purposes of retail, by the <i>secundum artem</i> abilities
of the parties concerned. Those who expect any
efficacious effects from the aniseed powder, should
grind (or see ground) the seeds themselves; for the
article sold in the shops under that name, is neither
more or less, than the <i>aniseed cakes</i> reduced to
powder in the common stock mill of the druggist,
<span class="pagenum">{24}</span>
from whence the essential oil has been previously
extracted.</p>

<h3>ANTIMONY</h3><p>—is, in its original state, a mineral,
extracted and separated from different ores by a peculiar
process of eliquation; the various medical preparations
from which, in the present state of hourly increasing
improvement, absolutely excite both surprise
and admiration. This article, now known
and proved of such general utility, was alternately
received into, and rejected from, a respectable rank
in medicine, by both the ancients and moderns, till
the more judicious and persevering speculatists established
its estimation upon a basis too firm ever
to be again shaken by the attack of whatever new
opinions may be introduced for its degradation.</p>

</div>

<p>The crude antimony, when reduced to a fine
and impalpable powder, is in many disorders full
as efficacious as its more subtle and elaborate preparations;
this observation appertaining to its effects
upon the human frame, to which it is administered
in all forms, by the most learned and eminent physicians
in every part of the enlightened world. In
respect to its corresponding effect upon one of our
most useful animals, the <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSE</span>, experience has
proved it to be a safe and certain medicine to obtund
acrimony, promote the secretions, open the
pores, refine the coat, and finally ensure condition;
hence it stands the principal ingredient in the well
<span class="pagenum">{25}</span>
known advertised "<span class="smcap">Alterative Powders</span>" of the
Author.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>ANTLERS</h3><p>,—used under different significations
to explain the various branches of what is called
the head (but divested of technical terms, the <i>horns</i>)
of a deer. Except with the huntsmen of stag
hounds, the keepers of parks, and out keepers of
forests and chaces, the infinity of old terms and
distinctions are become nearly obsolete; and
<span class="smcap lowercase">ANTLERS</span>
amongst sportsmen, as well as sporting rhymesters,
are now conceived to imply the whole head (alias
the horns) of the deer.</p>

<h3>APERIENTS</h3><p>—are medicines which mildly soften

moderate evacuation, without producing the

<div class="combine">

<h3>APERTURE</h3><p>;—a term in farriery, applied to
the orifice or opening of a tumour or abscess, whether
made by Nature, or by perforation with the
instrument of the operator: in either case the principal
consideration must be, to have it sufficiently
large for the transpiration of the offending matter
for which the effort was made; if in that respect it
is deficient, relief must be obtained from the hand
of the <span class="smcap lowercase">VETERINARIAN</span>.</p>

<h3>APOPLEXY</h3><p>,—in horses, a paralytic affection
of the brain, from too great or sudden flux of
blood to the part, too powerful exertions of strength
in drawing substances over heavy, or some pre-disposing
tendency to inflammation.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>APPUI</h3><p>—is a term used in equestrian education;
a perfect knowledge of which, Mr. Astley is of

great practice, under judicious, experienced and
able professors."</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>APPETITE</h3><p>,—if good, in either man or beast,
ought to be, and in most cases is, a clear criterion
and proof of health. However, instances are not
wanting, where a rule so seemingly just is sometimes
subject to exceptions. The quantity of good
and healthy food taken into the frame, is by no
means an infallible proof of strength, or of what
work the subject is, or ought to be, equal to:
some horses are the greatest <i>slugs</i> in nature, though
<i>always feeding</i>; while others, who undergo thrice
their labour, do not consume even a moderate share
of what is placed before them. This is probably
one of the latent operations of <span class="smcap">Nature</span>, upon
which it should seem human penetration is not permitted
to define, at least to a degree of certainty,
in respect to both origin and effect. Scientific aid,
and industrious investigation, may do much; but
when done, the enquiry will rest upon no better
<span class="pagenum">{27}</span>
grounds than undefined hypothesis, and unconfirmed
conjecture.</p>

</div>

<p>Here, then, appears most forcibly, the inutility
of going into an enquiry where no <i>certainty</i> of information
can be obtained: the labyrinth of perplexity
is better <i>unentered</i>, than to explore its most
difficult passages in the <i>dark</i>, without even a <i>chance</i>
of extrication. We have, indeed, been informed
by a publication of late years, that "<i>Appetite is a
painful sensation of the stomach, always accompanied
with a desire to eat</i>." It might, perhaps, have been
less "caviar to the multitude," and much nearer
the truth, if appetite had been defined, a <i>pleasing</i>
sensation, and <i>hunger</i> a <i>painful</i> one; particularly if
(for the sake of a paradox or an iricism) "accompanied
with <i>nothing</i> to eat." Waiving, therefore,
for the foregoing reasons of uncertainty, any intent
of going into a farther disquisition of <i>why</i> the appetite
is <i>good</i> or <i>bad</i>, it becomes necessary to proceed
to the facts which are known, and to point out
the proper remedies to insure relief.</p>

<p>When the appetite of a horse is seemingly never
satisfied; when he displays an immoderate and impatient
desire for food at all times; when, in failure
of repeated supplies of <i>hay</i> and <i>corn</i>, he is constantly
consuming his litter, (although it is none of
the cleanest;) such a horse is generally, and with
strict justice, denominated a <i>coarse</i> and <i>foul</i> feeder;
<span class="pagenum">{28}</span>
the result of which frequently is, that he soon becomes
as foul in his <i>blood</i>, his <i>coat</i>, and <i>condition</i>,
as he has previously proved himself in his inclination.
The ready road to relief in a case of this
kind, is to unload the frame of its accumulated
rubbish by a course of physic; the <i>rack rein</i> and
the <i>muzzle</i> are then such easy alternatives,
that those who do not chuse, or are too indolent,
to adopt them, must sit down easy under the defect.</p>

<p>Some there are who attribute the voracious dispositions,
and strong digestive powers, of such
horses to their being affected with <i>worms</i>. Such
reasoning may, with more propriety, be attributed
to the fertile imagination of those advocates, than
to any effect (of the kind mentioned) in the worms
themselves. That (worms being there) disquieting
or painful sensations, from some remote or internal
cause, may occasion a horse to pull out and disperse
his hay, to <i>pick</i>, <i>scrape</i>, and <i>disorder</i> his <i>litter</i>, in
proof of disorder or discontent, may readily be
conceived; but that absolute pain from the corroding
misery of living insects, <i>preying</i> upon the very
<i>vitals</i> of an animal, shall give him an <i>increased appetite</i>
to <i>eat</i>, is a doctrine that cannot be so readily
believed.</p>

<p>Horses of a contrary description, who labour
occasionally under a <i>loss of appetite</i>, is no such
<span class="pagenum">{29}</span>
matter of ambiguity as what has been just described;
but may with certainty be ascribed to its proper
cause, by minutely attending to such signs, and
predominant symptoms, as present themselves to
the eye, and to the touch of the diligent enquirer.
A loss of appetite in horses whose constitutions are
generally good, and who have not been remarked
for refusing their corn, or being <i>off their feed</i>, sufficiently
indicate some tendency to either slight and
temporary indisposition, or impending disease; as
<i>cold</i>, <i>cough</i>, <i>febrile heat</i> from the fatigue of a long
journey on the road, or exertion in the field; intestinal
disquietude, from flatulent affection, or
pain in the <i>kidnies</i>; as well as a stricture upon the
<i>neck of the bladder</i>, proceeding from a preternatural
retention of <i>urine</i>, in having travelled too far
"<i>without drawing bit</i>." This is the exulting practice
of too many <i>unthinking</i> masters, and <i>indiscreet</i>
servants; it, however, holds forth no proof of the
goodness of the <i>head</i> or the <i>heart</i> in either one or
the other. This defect, proceeding from whatever
cause, cannot be too soon properly attended to:
early and attentive investigation should be made as
the first and most necessary step to the acquisition
of relief. Admitting it to have originated in any
of those causes already described, there is very
little doubt to be entertained, but a moderate <i>bleeding</i>,
a <i>cordial ball</i>, a mash of <i>ground malt</i> and <i>bran</i>,
equal parts, with warm soft water, and a little
<span class="pagenum">{30}</span>
nursing, if expeditiously proceeded upon, will soon
set all to rights again.</p>

<p>Not so with those whose defect is constitutional,
proceeding from an inexplicable degree of irritability,
so generally and palpably evident in both <i>attitude</i>
and <i>action</i>; in the stable, or out, they never
appear perfectly at ease; the eye, the ear, seeming
alarmed with every sound, as if in perpetual search
of new causes to keep up the unceasing spirit of
discontent and eternal disquietude. Upon the road
in company, or in the field with hounds, they invariably
and impatiently court competition, making
the most violent exertions to prove their great,
passionate, and ill-tempered desire for superiority;
so that horses of this description, after a journey
of some length, or a chase of severe duration, are
not only off their appetites for <i>two</i> or <i>three</i> days,
but hardly fit to be seen again for <i>a week</i>. They
are mostly light, and what is termed <i>fluey in the carcase</i>;
carry no flesh, with or without work; and
for that reason, do no credit <i>in appearance</i> to their
master. Yet, strange as it may appear to those unacquainted
with the fact, horses or mares of this
restless, unsettled disposition, are almost so invariably
good and persevering in nature, that they will
continue to exert themselves, till, becoming totally
exhausted, they must sink under fatigue, rather than
permit themselves to be restrained; a palpable contrast
<i>in spirit</i> to those voracious, gummy-legged
<span class="pagenum">{31}</span>
gluttons, who, after an insatiate series of gormandizing
and rest, absolutely tire (or "<i>knock up</i>")
in the second stage, or <i>first twenty miles</i>, of a
journey.</p>

<p>This defect, (or more properly deficiency in appetite
and disinclination of food,) whether proceeding
from the fiery volatility of temper impatient of
restraint, or a peculiar laxity of the parts necessary
to strong digestion, is so clearly inherent, so truly
constitutional, that a well-founded expectation of
permanent relief, or total eradication, is not to be
formed upon any change that can be made in food,
or improvement in attention. Such horses, however,
if their paces are good, and they are desirable
in other respects, should not be too <i>hastily</i> disposed
of; instances having been very frequent,
where horses of such irritable habit, and fretful disposition,
when young, have, when accustomed to
the same stable, gentle usage, and to one rider only,
become as settled feeders, good goers, round
carcased and firm fleshed horses as any in the kingdom.
Some inducement to feed after the fatigues
(or <i>frettings</i>) just recited, may be attempted by the
means before described; few occasions will occur
where the malt mashes will be refused; the novel
fragrancy attracts attention, and when once taken,
its invigorating property soon appears. In cases
where the stomach continues weak, the carcase thin,
and appetite not restored, an occasional use of the
<span class="pagenum">{32}</span>
<i>pectoral cordial balls</i>, once or even twice a day, is
the proper substitute for aliment, and will seldom
or ever fail to produce the desired effect.</p>

<h3>AQUATIC</h3><p>,—appertaining to water. Fish are

in the soil beneath, and vegetate as well <i>below</i> as
upon the <i>surface</i> of the water. An <i>aquatic excursion</i>
is a party of pleasure upon the water.</p>

<h3>ARSENIC</h3><p>,—is a most certain and destructive

Take (in the season when they are to be obtained)
a dozen large apples; let them be pared, and the
cores extracted; then chop them exceedingly fine,
till they are almost a paste; to which add half an
ounce of arsenic, reduced to powder, and two
ounces of coarse sugar; mix well, and let this
be distributed in their <i>usual haunts</i>, remembering to
let earthen pans be set with <i>plenty of water</i> within
their reach; and the sudden thirst they are seized
with, after eating the smallest quantity of the composition,
is so violent, that they drink till unable
<span class="pagenum">{33}</span>
to move from the spot; and if the preparation is
made over night, and the rats are plenty, they will
be found in the morning swelled to the utmost extent,
and lying dead in different parts, as if they
had fallen victims to a fashionable dropsy.</p>

to the bottom: if it is not so, but mostly of a

<h3>ASCARIDES</h3><p>—are a species of worms, to
which horses are frequently subject, from two to
three inches long: they are not larger in circumference
than a common knitting needle, have a flat
head, and in some degree not unlike the millepedes,
at least in respect to their number of legs.
They are in general voided with the dung, where
they may be seen twirling and twisting about with
wonderful rapidity, not unlike a grig, or small eel,
when thrown out of his own element upon the
grass. Horses persecuted with these painful and
troublesome companions, are generally relaxed in
the intestines, and throw off their dung in a <i>loose
state</i>, affording, by that circumstance alone, sufficient
proof how much they irritate internally, as
well as why horses affected with <i>worms</i>, are not
only low in flesh, but rough in coat, and almost
every way out of condition.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>ASTHMATIC</h3><p>.—Horses are considered <i>asthmatic</i>,
or thick-winded, who have acquired a difficulty
of respiration, and a short husky cough, from
blood originally dense and sizey having been permitted
to become proportionally <i>viscid</i>, from a
want of <i>evacuants</i> and <i>attenuants</i> in time to have
prevented the obstructions which lay the foundation
of this troublesome defect. The viscidity of the
<span class="pagenum">{35}</span>
blood constituting obstructions in the finer vessels,
produce tubercles in the lungs, which, rendering
their action partial and imperfect, occasions the
difficulty of breathing, and repetition of cough, so
constantly observed during the increased circulation
of the blood, when the horse is brought into use.
Frequent <i>bleedings</i>, and a course of the Author's
<span class="smcap">Pectoral Detergent Balls</span>, are the best means
of alleviation and cure.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>ASTRINGENTS</h3><p>—is rather a medical than either
a general or sporting term, and implies any
article in food or medicine, possessing the property
of restraining a too great flux of excrement after
physic, or a too lax state of body, (denominated
looseness,) proceeding from a previous fulness, or
from intestinal acrimony, where the discharges have
been a mere effort of Nature to relieve herself from
the load, and not in consequence of any purgative
whatever. In such flaccidity of the intestines, proceeding
from whatever cause, a cordial ball occasionally,
small quantities of liquid laudanum in
gruel, and an ounce of gum arabic dissolved, and
given night and morning in the water, will soon
restore them to their proper state.</p>

<h3>ATTACHMENTS</h3><p>—Court of, a ceremony or
court peculiar to the laws of a forest, and necessary
to be known only by those who reside therein.
The officers of this court do no more than receive
<span class="pagenum">{36}</span>
the <i>attachments</i> of the <i>foresters</i>, and enrol them in
the <span class="smcap">VERDERERS'</span> rolls, that they may be ready for
the court of <i>swainmote</i> when held. This court of
attachments having no power to determine upon
cases of offence or trespass beyond the value of
<i>fourpence</i>, all above that sum must appear in the
verderers' rolls, and be sent by them to the court
of swainmote, there to be tried according to the
forest laws, which are replete with peculiar privileges,
immunities, and what are termed royalties,
appertaining to the Crown itself.</p>

<h3>ATTAINT</h3><p>—has been used, by members of the
old school in farriery, for blows, bruises, cuts,

and may probably never be heard again, farther
exposition becomes unnecessary.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>ATTRACTION</h3><p>—is positively, in some respects,
the best property (if it can be so termed)
a horse can possibly possess, at least so far as it is
admitted to exceed every other qualification in its
effect upon the mind of the owner during the time
he is in possession; as well as no inconsiderable
gratification of pecuniary expectation when the
horse comes to be sold. The great advantage
arising from <i>attraction</i> in a horse is, that, however
vexatious his defects in respect to temper and action
may be, he will never hang upon hand, or the
<span class="pagenum">{37}</span>
owner be long in want of a customer, if external
figure and good colour do but afford <i>attraction</i> in
any tolerable degree. There are always those in
pursuit of horses for purchase, who more know
what constitutes <i>figure</i> at <i>first sight</i>, than what
constitutes <i>good points</i> after a week's examination.
Two good ends (as the dealers term them) <i>well set
on</i>, and <i>both up</i>, go a great way in the fashionable
work of attraction; without one or both of which,
a horse can never become a commanding figure,
either before or behind; and, strange as it may be
thought by the young or inexperienced, there are
numerous instances of horses bearing, in their general
appearance, a kind of <i>attracting uniformity</i>,
that, upon critical investigation, are found not to
have any distinguishing point of excellence about
them. Those, however, who have the prudence
to bear in memory the effect of <i>attraction</i>, and to
secure it when they <i>buy</i>, will never be at much loss
when they <i>sell</i>: it will be also by no means inapplicable
to have it equally "in the mind's eye," that
many horses without attraction are <i>too dear at nothing</i>.</p>

<h3>BABBLER</h3><p>—is a hound upon whose tongue

that "a liar is not to be believed although he

the large Hartley mare, got by Mr. Hartley's blind
horse; her dam Flying Wig, by Williams's Woodstock
Arabian; grand-dam by the St. Victor Barb,
out of a daughter of Whynot, son of the Fenwick
Barb. He became a <span class="smcap lowercase">STALLION</span> of much celebrity,
having been the sire of Sir Isaac Lowther's Babraham,
Mr. Leedes's Young Babraham, Babraham

<h3>BACK</h3><p>—of a horse, the very part upon which
the centrical point of beauty principally depends.
If he is long in the back, narrow across the loins,
flat in the ribs, and light in the carcase, (however
well he may be otherways furnished with <i>good</i>
<span class="pagenum">{39}</span>
<i>points</i>,) he will never be considered either a handsome
or strong horse. Horses of this description
are in general good goers as to <i>speed</i>, but very
little to be relied on in <i>hard</i> service, or <i>long</i> journies.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BACKING</h3><p>—is the term used for the first time
of mounting a colt (or taking seat upon the saddle)
after he has been previously <i>handled</i>, <i>quieted</i>,
<i>stabled</i>, and accustomed to the mouthing-bit, the
cavezon, martingal, lunging-rein, saddle, and the
whole of the apparatus with which he has been led
his different paces in <i>the ring</i>: all this he should
be brought to submit to most quietly, as well as to
the being <i>saddled</i>, and every part of liable discipline,
before any attempt is made to <i>back</i> him; if
not, it cannot be termed a systematic completion
of the business. As <i>backing</i> a <i>colt</i> (after every
precaution) requires a certain degree of cool and
steady fortitude appertaining principally to the
<i>breaker</i>, whose province it is, (and is but little attempted
by others,) a minute description of the
means and ceremony could prove but of little utility
here, and is of course for that reason dispensed
with.</p>

</div>

<p>Opinion and practice have very much varied
in respect to the age most proper for backing a
colt, or even taking him in hand. Not more than
half a century past, colts were never touched (upon
the score of <i>handling</i>) till rising <i>four</i>, backed and
<span class="pagenum">{40}</span>
brought into very gentle use when rising <i>five</i>, and
never seen in constant work till nearly or <i>full six
years old</i>. But so wonderfully has fashionable refinement
operated upon the human mind, and so
constantly is it agitated by the fascinating effusions
of novelty and innovation, that we now find colts
handled at <i>two</i>, broke (and racing) at <i>three</i>, and in
constant work at <i>four</i>, in every part of the kingdom;
in consequence of which impatient and premature
<i>improvement</i> upon the judgment and practice
of our forefathers, we now daily observe
horses at five, six, and seven years old, more impaired
in their powers, than they formerly were at
double that age, to the evident production of
strained sinews, swelled legs, splents, sprains, wind-galls,
and the long list of ills so admirably calculated
for the support of the new generation of veterinarians,
who are daily emerging from obscurity,
and for whom employment must necessarily be obtained.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BACK SINEWS</h3><p>,—so called in a horse, are the
tendons extending from the junction of the knee,
at the back of the shank-bone to the fetlock joint,
where they are inserted. These parts are so much
acted upon, and partake so palpably of the labour
in which the animal is constantly engaged, that they
are eternally liable to injury from over work, rolling
stones, deep ground, or projecting prominences
in the pavement of large towns. When injuries
<span class="pagenum">{41}</span>
of this kind are severe, and threaten, by <i>swelling</i>
and <i>inflammation</i>, some duration, a repetition
of work should be by all means avoided. A
speedy and permanent cure principally depends
upon the first steps taken for relief, to which mild
treatment, attention, unremitting care, and rest,
will conjunctively contribute. In most cases <i>too
much</i> is done in <i>too short</i> a time, to gratify either
the impatience of the owner, or the pecuniary sensations
of his medical monitor; burning applications
(increasing the original inflammation) of what
they term <i>hot oils</i>, followed up by <i>blisters</i> of extra
strength, and lastly, the humane (and frequently
ineffectual) operation of the <i>firing irons</i>, constitute
the routine of professional practice, to the utter rejection
of milder means, and the indications of nature,
who, with the assistance of rest, would frequently
effect her own purpose, and complete a
cure.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BACK RAKING</h3><p>—is an operation of which
confident grooms, and indolent farriers, are too
frequently fond. It is introducing the hand at the
sphincter ani, to extract the indurated fæces, or
hardened dung, from the rectum, in which the
horse must experience considerable pain, that
would be better avoided by the more humane and
considerate administration of <i>a clyster</i>. By this a
repetition of the more slovenly and less efficacious
operation would be rendered unnecessary, as well
<span class="pagenum">{42}</span>
as the original intent more expeditiously promoted.
There can be but little doubt, under the present
improved practice, that means of relief so singular
and unnatural, will soon give place to, and be totally
superseded by, methods of greater neatness
and humanity in their operation, and greater certainty
in the effect.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BADGER</h3><p>.—Though this animal cannot be said
to afford sport to the superior classes, he is entitled
to notice here, in conformity with the original intent
and title of the Work. Former writers have,
with a greater attention to the fertility of invention,
than any respect to truth, held forth a seemingly
plausible description of <span class="smcap lowercase">BADGERS</span> of two <i>distinct</i>
and <i>separate</i> kinds, under the different appellation
of a dog-badger and hog-badger; the former
having feet resembling <i>a dog</i>; the feet of the latter
<i>cloven</i>, exactly similar to those of <i>the hog</i>. To
strengthen this assertion, they tell you they subsist
on different food; that the one eats with eagerness
any kind of flesh and carrion as a dog; the other,
roots, fruits, and vegetables, as a hog. This,
however, may be justly considered the effect of
fiction, or of a too <i>enlarged imagination</i>, as the existence
of only one kind of badger is admitted
amongst us, with such trifling difference in size or
colour, as may happen from age, the peculiar soil of
any particular county, or other such collateral circumstance
as may add something to the size in one
<span class="pagenum">{43}</span>
part of the kingdom, or vary a shade or two in the
colours of another.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunting</span> the badger is no more than an occasional
sport with rustics of the lower order, and
can only be enjoyed by moonlight; the badger,
from his natural habits, being never to be found
above ground by day. In this sport they are
obliged to oppose <i>art</i> to <i>cunning</i>, and obtain by
stratagem what they cannot effect by strength. At
a late hour in the evening, when the badger is naturally
concluded to have left his <i>kennel</i> or his <i>castle</i>,
in search of prey, some of the party (as previously
adjusted) proceed to place a sack <i>at length</i>
within the burrow, so constructed that the mouth
of the sack directly corresponds with the mouth of
the earth, and is secured in that position by means
of a willow hoop, which, from its pliability, readily
submits to the form required. This part of the
business being completed, the parties withdrawn,
and the <i>signal whistle</i> given, their distant companions
lay on the dogs, (either hounds, terriers, lurchers,
or spaniels,) encouraging them through the
neighbouring woods, coppices, and hedge rows,
which the badgers abroad no sooner find, than being
alarmed, and well knowing their inability to
continue a state of warfare so much out of their
own element, they instantly make to the earth for
shelter, where, for want of an alternative, and oppressed
with fear, they rush into certain destruction,
<span class="pagenum">{44}</span>
by entering the sack, where being entangled, (by
the rapidity with which they enter,) they are soon
secured by those who are fixed near the spot for
that purpose.</p>

<p>If he escapes by the ill construction or accidental
falling of the sack, (which is sometimes the
case,) and enters the earth with safety, <i>digging him
out</i> is not only a certain laborious attempt, but
with a very <i>precarious</i> termination; for the badger
possessing instinctively much art, ingenuity, and
perseverance, has generally formed his retreat with
no small strength resulting from natural fortification;
to render which the more probably tenable
against the premeditated attacks of constant and
implacable enemies, it is most frequently formed
amongst the roots of some old pollard, in the banks
of moors, or unfrequented ground, or underneath
a hollow tree, from amidst the large and spreading
roots of which the burrows run in such remote and
ramified directions, that his assailants are compelled,
by loss of time and labour, (after digging fifteen or
twenty feet,) to relinquish the pursuit, and abandon
the contest: corroborating the opinion of countrymen
in general, that, in a light or sandy soil, badgers
can make way as fast from their pursuers, as
the latter erroneously <i>conceive</i> they are gaining
ground upon them, and to this perhaps it is owing
that there are so many <i>drawn battles</i> between the
pursuers and the pursued.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{45}</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Badger baiting</span> is a different sport, and exceedingly
prevalent in both town and country, particularly
with the butchers, and lower orders in the
environs of the metropolis, for whom a constant
supply of badgers, from the woods of Essex, Kent,
and Surry, were sure to be obtained. To so great
a pitch of celebrity had this <i>sublime amusement</i> attained
in the neighbourhood of Tottenham Court
and Islington, that the magistrates most laudably
exerted themselves to put an end to a <i>pleasurable
business</i>, which brought together an infinity of the
most abandoned miscreants, with their <i>bull dogs</i> and
<i>terriers</i>, from every extremity of the town. To the
dreadful and inhuman scene of baiting <i>bears</i> and
<i>badgers</i> (with the most ferocious dogs) till nature
was quite exhausted, succeeded <i>dog fights</i>, <i>boxing
matches</i>, and every species of the most incredible
infamy under sanction of the <i>knights</i> of the <i>cleaver</i>;
till, by the persevering efforts of the more humane
inhabitants, and the spirited determination of magistracy,
the practice seems totally abolished, and
likely to be buried in a much-wished-for oblivion.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BALLS</h3><p>,—medicines so called when prepared in
that form, as they now mostly are, for the mitigation
and cure of almost every disease to which the
horse is incident. There are purging balls of various
kinds, prepared of proportional strengths, and
compounded of different ingredients, with or without
the impregnation of mercury, according to the
<span class="pagenum">{46}</span>
<i>state</i>, <i>disease</i>, or <i>condition</i> of the subject. Mild and
strong diuretic balls, for cracked heels, swelled legs,
fluctuating humours, and grease. Pectoral cordial
balls, for colds, as well as to be given after severe
chases, or long journeys: they are also useful when
a horse is off his appetite, as well as an excellent
preventative to cold when a horse has been long
out of the stable, in sharp winds or chilling rains.
Pectoral detergent balls, for obstinate coughs, and
thick-winded horses. Likewise balls for flatulent
and inflammatory cholic, as well as for strangury
and other disorders. Articles of this description
are usually prepared from the prescriptions of those
authors who have written upon farriery and veterinary
medicine; but, for the accommodation of the
public at large, and to prevent the <i>abuses</i> sometimes
attendant upon the casual preparation in shops, by
the inattention of servants, or the privilege and
<i>practice</i> of substituting <i>one</i> article for <i>another</i>, the
Author, immediately after the publication and success
of his "<i>Stable Directory</i>" prepared his own
advertised medicines, which have now been fourteen
years honoured with public patronage, a list of which,
with the prices, will be found annexed to this
Work.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BALSAMICS</h3><p>,—in medicine, is a kind of indefinite
term, upon which the most eminent writers
have hardly agreed: but however they may have
differed in respect to derivation, there can be no doubt
<span class="pagenum">{47}</span>
but the true sense of the word must appertain to
such nutritive emollients, and gelatinous restoratives,
as heal without, and invigorate within. The
term is more generally applied to medicines administered
in disorders of the <i>chest</i> and <i>lungs</i>.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BARBS</h3><p>—are horses brought from the coast of
Barbary, and mostly consigned as presents to His
Majesty, or some other branch of the royal family.
Those arriving under such distinction, are to be
considered the true <span class="smcap lowercase">MOUNTAIN BARB</span>,
the <i>pedigree</i> of
whose <i>blood</i> has been recorded with as much tenacity
and care as the genealogy of our most ancient
nobility. <span class="smcap">Barbs</span> (as they are called) are to be
found in the possession of many people of fashion
and fortune in England, but they are in general of
inferior degree, and thought to be only the <i>common</i>
horses of the country from whence they came: such
there are at all times to be obtained through the intervening
medium of <i>Provence</i> and <i>Languedoc</i>
in France; but in this kingdom they are held in
very slender estimation; not more for their deficiency
in <i>growth</i> and <i>strength</i>, than the aukwardness of
their <i>action</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Barbs</span> were formerly in great request here; and
neither trouble or expence was spared to obtain
them, for the sole purpose of improving the speed
of our own <i>breed</i> for the <span class="smcap lowercase">TURF</span>,
where, upon the
<span class="pagenum">{48}</span>
various events in <span class="smcap lowercase">RACING</span> at
<span class="smcap">Newmarket</span>, and in
the <i>north</i>, immense sums are frequently depending;
and from the various <i>crosses</i> in <i>blood</i>, the breeding
<i>in and in</i>, with the different fancied <i>interlineations</i>
by different individuals, it is affirmed, by some of
those best versed in racing pedigree, that there
are at this time a very few (if any) thorough bred
<span class="smcap">English horses</span>, but what have a cross of <i>foreign
blood</i> in their composition. To elucidate or justify
this opinion, reference may be made to the well authenticated
list of <span class="smcap">Barbs</span> and <span class="smcap">Arabians</span>,
who have contributed, as <i>stallions</i>, more or less, to the increase
of the most select and valuable studs in every
part of the kingdom.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Helmsley Turk</span> (one of the first we can
go back to) was the property of an old Duke of
Buckingham, and afterwards of Mr. Place, (studmaster
to Oliver Cromwell when Protector,) in
whose possession he got <i>Bustler</i>, &amp;c. Mr. Place
had also a stallion, called <span class="smcap">Place's White Turk</span>,
who was the sire of <i>Wormwood</i>, <i>Commoner</i>, and other
good horses.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Stradling</span> or <span class="smcap">Lister Turk</span>
was brought into England by the Duke of Berwick, from the
siege of Buda, in the reign of James the Second.
He got <i>Snake</i>, <i>Brisk</i>, <i>Piping Peg</i>, <i>Coneyskins</i>,
&amp;c.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{49}</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Byerley Turk</span> was Captain Byerley's
charger in Ireland in King William's wars, 1689,
and was afterwards the sire of many good runners.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Greyhound</span> was got in Barbary by a white
Barb, out of Slugey, a natural Barb mare. After
the <i>leap</i>, both sire and dam were purchased and
brought to England by Mr. Marshall, where the
sire became one of King William's stud, and was
called the "White Barb Chillaby." Greyhound
was the sire of <i>Othello</i>, <i>Whitefoot</i>, <i>Osmyn</i>, <i>Rake</i>,
<i>Sampson</i>, <i>Goliah</i>, <i>Favorite</i>, <i>Desdemona</i>, and others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D'Arcy White Turk</span> got old <i>Hautboy</i>,
<i>Grey Royal</i>,
<i>Cannon</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D'Arcy Yellow Turk</span> was the sire of <i>Spanker</i>,
<i>Brimmer</i>, and the great great grand-dam of
<i>Cartouch</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Curwen's Bay Barb</span> was a present from Muly
Ishmael, Emperor of Morocco, to Lewis the Fourteenth,
and was brought to England by Mr. Curwen,
who procured from Count Byram and Count
Thoulouse (natural sons of the French King) the
two horses afterwards called the <i>Curwen Bay Barb</i>
and <i>Thoulouse Barb</i>, both which proved excellent
stallions, getting a great number of winners, and
transmitting their blood through the sisters of <i>Mixbury</i>
to <i>Partner</i>, <i>Little Scar</i>, <i>Soreheels</i>, and the
<span class="pagenum">{50}</span>
dam of <i>Crab</i>; as well as to <i>Bagpiper</i>, <i>Blacklegs</i>,
Panton's <i>Molly</i>, and the dam of <i>Cinnamon</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Darley's Arabian</span> was brought over by a brother
of Mr. Darley in Yorkshire, who being a
commercial agent abroad, exerted his interest to
procure the horse. He was sire of the famous horse
<i>Childers</i>, (who was said to have ran a <i>mile</i> in a <i>minute</i>,)
<i>Dædalus</i>, <i>Dart</i>, <i>Skipjack</i>, <i>Aleppo</i>, and other
good horses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J. Williams's Turk</span> got Mr. Honeywood's
<i>two True Blues</i>, out of the only thorough-bred mare
he was ever known to cover; though he got some
middling racers out of common mares, whose pedigrees
were not known.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Belgrade Turk</span> was taken at the siege of
Belgrade, and, after passing through the hands of
General Merci, the Prince de Craon, and the Prince
of Lorrain, became the property of Sir Marmaduke
Wyvill, in whose possession he died about 1740.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Croft's Bay Barb</span> was got by <i>Chillaby</i> out of
the Moonah Barb Mare.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Godolphin Arabian</span> was the property of
Lord Godolphin, and thought so little of as a
stallion, and so little likely to get racers, that he
was for some years <i>teazer</i> to <i>Hobgoblin</i>; but, upon
his refusing to cover <i>Roxana</i>, the Arabian had the
<span class="pagenum">{51}</span>
<i>leap</i>, which produced <i>Lath</i>, the first horse he ever
got. To Lath succeeded <i>Cade</i>, <i>Regulus</i>, <i>Blank</i>,
<i>Babraham</i>, <i>Bajazet</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c. and there can be no
doubt, from the success of the progeny of each,
but that he contributed more to the value and speed
of horses for the turf, than any other foreign
stallion ever brought into this kingdom.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Cullen Arabian</span> was sire of <i>Camillus</i>, <i>Sour
Face</i>, the <i>dam</i> of <i>Regulator</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Coombe Arabian</span>, called also the <i>Pigot
Arabian</i>, was sire of <i>Methodist</i>, the <i>dam</i> of <i>Cross</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Compton Barb</span>, or <i>Sedley Arabian</i>, was sire
of <i>Coquette</i>, <i>Greyling</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Arcot Arabian</span> has been covering a few
years in the neighbourhood of the metropolis, but
has not produced any thing of note. This may
probably happen from a want of interest in procuring
<i>thorough-bred mares</i>, without which a stallion
for racing blood can acquire no celebrity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">King Charles</span> the Second sent over his master
of the horse to procure a number of foreign horses
and mares for breeding; and the mares brought over
by him, as well as many of their produce, have
since been called <i>Royal Mares</i>. <span class="smcap">Dodsworth</span>,
though foaled in England, was a natural Barb;
his dam was imported <i>in foal</i> during the time of
<span class="pagenum">{52}</span>
Charles the Second, and was sold for forty guineas
at twenty years old, (after the King's death,) then
in foal (by the Helmsley Turk) of <i>Vixen</i>, afterwards
dam of the old Child Mare.</p>

<p>However largely this description of horses may
have contributed to the improvement of blood in
this country, and however grand and majestic they
may appear in competition with our more settled,
steady, and well-broke studs; yet, when the <i>uniformity</i>
of <i>parts</i> which constitute <i>the whole</i> come to be
judiciously examined, and every <i>point</i> of <i>perfection</i>
precisely ascertained, no doubt can or need be
entertained, but the best bred horses in Britain,
as <i>Highflyer</i>, <i>Escape</i>, <i>Rockingham</i>, <i>Hambletonian</i>,
<i>Diamond</i>, and many others, must stand firmly entitled
to the palm of priority. The most accurate
must have observed, that the major part of the
horses brought to this country as Barbs and Arabians,
being submitted to public inspection, are very much
inferior in height to our own, few reaching, and
<i>none exceeding</i>, fifteen hands: they have mostly a
curvilinear hollowness of the back, a narrowness
of the chest, (indicative of <i>speed</i>, but the reverse
of <i>strength</i>,) and a palpable deficiency in the arm
or <i>fore thigh</i>, seemingly disproportioned to their
own weight. Their apparent powers are entirely
appropriate to the purposes of <i>speed</i>, and not to
the common services of the people of this country;
being, in general, bad, uneven walkers; and once
<span class="pagenum">{53}</span>
exerted to <i>a trot</i>, their legs are thrown about in
the clambering manner of the German cavalry,
much more adapted to the gratification of pompous
parade, than the neatness or utility of expeditious
action.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BARS</h3><p>—are the fleshy ridges at the upper part
of a horse's mouth. These ridges are always more
prominent in <i>young</i> horses than in <i>old</i>. When they
are luxuriant towards the front teeth, and, with a
kind of elastic puffiness, project and prevent mastication,
they are called <span class="smcap">Lampas</span>, (which see.) In
all cases of emergency where bleeding is necessary,
and the apparatus not at hand, particularly <i>in the
night</i>, an incision or two across the bars with the
fleam, instantly answers the purpose, and prevents
farther ceremony.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BAT FOWLING</h3><p>—is a favorite sport with farmer's
servants on a winter's evening, and can only
be enjoyed with a degree of success proportioned
by the darkness of the night. The party should
not consist of less than four; two of whom are provided
with long flimsey hazel sticks or hurdle rods;
the third carries and manages the flap, (or folding
net;) and the fourth a candle and lanthorn, suspended
to the end of <i>a pole</i> seven or eight feet long.
Upon the net being spread, by separating the side
rods to their utmost extent, before the <i>corn-rick</i>,
<i>out-houses</i>, <i>eaves</i> of <i>stable thatch</i>, <i>yew hedge</i>, or
<span class="pagenum">{54}</span>
whatever spot it is intended to try, the candle and
lanthorn is then to be held up as nearly the centre
of the net as possible, but at about three or four feet
distance, just before the assistants begin to beat the
<i>rick</i>, <i>thatch</i>, or <i>hedge</i>, with their poles; when the
birds being thus suddenly alarmed from their resting-place,
make instantly for the light, when the net
being directly closed (if by a skilful practitioner)
the success is beyond description; it being no uncommon
thing, in large remote farms, and in severe
winters, to take twenty or thirty dozen of sparrows,
and other small birds, in one evening's diversion.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BATTLE ROYAL</h3><p>—was formerly (much more
than at present) a favorite mode of fighting amongst
<span class="smcap lowercase">COCKERS</span> of the <i>lower order</i>,
who, upon the old
maxim of "the more danger the more honor," became
practical advocates for general destruction in
the following way. A battle royal may consist of
any number of cocks, but is hardly ever known to
exceed <i>eight</i>. The owner of each having made
good his <i>stake</i>, or previously contributed his share
of the <i>prize</i> or <i>purse</i> for which they fight, and all
parties being ready, the cocks are most <i>inhumanly</i>
pitted at the same moment, when a long and distressing
scene ensues, to which there is no termination
so long as a <i>second</i> cock is left alive, and the victory
can only be obtained by the last survivor.
This species of sport is but little practised now,
<span class="pagenum">{55}</span>
and that in the most distant and remote corners of
the kingdom.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BAY</h3><p>—the colour of a horse so called, and is
the most esteemed of any other in constituting the
beauty of the horse. They have invariably black
manes and tails, are many shades lighter than a
brown horse, and were originally called <i>bay</i> from
their affinity to the leaf of the bay tree. There are,
however, some degrees of difference and variations
in those so termed: for instance, there is the light
or yellow bay, the brown bay, and the mottled bay.
Bay horses with black legs have the preference of
all other colours, and now almost wholly constitute
the racing breed of this country.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BAY</h3><p>—is a sporting term, and used in the following
sense. When a stag has been so long pursued
that, finding his speed or strength nearly exhausted,
he turns round, (having some protection of building
or paling in his rear,) and facing the hounds, resolutely
defends himself with his <i>antlers</i>, keeping
the hounds at <i>bay</i>, till the sportsmen come up, who
immediately assist in drawing off the hounds, and
saving the life of the deer. When the deer takes
<i>soil</i>, (that is, takes to the water,) he will defend
himself, and keep the hounds a long time at <i>bay</i>,
provided he fathoms the lake or river so well as to
keep the hounds <i>swimming</i>, and not go out of his
<i>own</i> depth; if he loses which, and is obliged to
<i>swim</i> at the time <i>he is up</i>, (in other words, quite
<span class="pagenum">{56}</span>
tired,) and surrounded by the hounds, he is inevitably
drowned by his numerous and determined foes,
in opposition to every exertion that can be made
to save him.</p>

</div>

<p>In fox-hunting, when the fox is supposed to have
gone to earth, the fact can only be ascertained in many
cases by the excellence of the terrier attending the
pack, who has in general strength and speed sufficient
to keep him from being far behind. Upon entering
the earth, discovery is soon made of the certainty
of his retreat, by the terrier's "<i>laying well at him</i>,"
provided the fox has not <i>turned</i> in the earth: if he
has so done, and they are face to face, they are
both <i>baying</i>, or keeping each other <i>at bay</i>, till the
controversy ends in <i>digging out</i> the fox, and letting
in the hounds for their <i>share</i> of the entertainment,
with the additional acquisition of <i>blood</i> for the advantage
of the pack.</p>

<h3>BAY BOLTON</h3><p>—was bred by <span class="smcap">Mr. Vernon</span>;
foaled in 1777: he was got by Matchem, dam by
Regulus, out of an own sister to the Ancaster
Starling. He has long been in the possession of
his Majesty, and was for many years the favorite
stallion at Hampton Court, from whom most of
his Majesty's present stud were produced.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BAY MALTON</h3><p>—was esteemed the first horse of
his year in the kingdom, and won more prizes of
consequence and value than any horse of his time.
<span class="pagenum">{57}</span>
He was bred by the then <span class="smcap">Marquis of Rockingham</span>;
was foaled in 1760; got by Sampson, dam by
Cade, and grand-dam by Old Traveller. It is believed
he never covered as a <span class="smcap lowercase">STALLION</span>: if so, he
produced no horses of note.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BAY TREE</h3><p>—The leaves of which are so useful
in fomentations, and the berries in clysters,
for horses upon every emergency, particularly remote
from towns, that sporting gentlemen in the country
should never be without a tree of this description
upon their premises.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BEAGLES</h3><p>,—in early stages of the sporting
world, was an appellation of much more definite
meaning than in the <i>polish</i> of the <i>present times</i>, and
was then used to signify a brace or two of the tanned
or pied hounds of small dimensions, with which
the country squire or opulent farmer <i>picked</i> and
<i>chopped</i> the trail of a hare to her form for a course
with his greyhounds. As they were, however, so
constantly useful in recovering the hare after the
<i>first</i> course, and bringing her to view for <i>a second</i>,
it became in a great degree stigmatized by sportsmen
in general, and is now considered neither more or
less than <i>one mode</i> of <i>poaching</i> under the sanction of
legal authority. Many packs of these small beagles
(for beagle then implied the <i>smallest</i> kind of hound
known) were formerly kept by country gentlemen
at a very trifling expence, and with no small share
<span class="pagenum">{58}</span>
of amusement to their rustic neighbours; for, although
those who joined in the chase might be numerous,
yet <i>two</i> or <i>three horsemen only</i> were seen
in the field, so easy was it to keep up with the
hounds (alias beagles) on foot. They were in general
so well matched, that they did not exceed eleven
inches in height; and ran so well together, they (to
speak technically,) "might be covered with a
sheet." Though they were <i>slow</i>, they were <i>sure</i>;
for if the scent lay well, a hare could seldom escape
them; and this, to the object of pursuit, mostly
proved a lingering as well as a certain death: for
though, in the early parts of the chase, they could
never get near enough to <i>press</i> her, they were frequently
<i>two</i> or <i>three</i> hours in killing.</p>

</div>

<p>In proportion to the increasing spirit of the
times, <i>slow hunting</i> declined, and beagles of this
kind got in disrepute. The numerous crosses in
the breed of both beagles and hounds, according to
the wishes and inclinations of those who keep them,
have so diversified the variety, that a volume might
be produced, in a description of the different sorts
and sizes adapted to the soil and surface where they
hunt; from the old <i>heavy, deep tongued, dew-lapped
southern hound</i> of <span class="smcap">Manchester</span>, (where the huntsman
with his long pole goes on foot,) to the highest
crossed harriers of the present day, who kill the
stoutest hares in <i>thirty</i> and <i>forty</i> minutes with a
speed not much inferior to coursing. <span class="smcap">Beagles</span>,
when the term is now used, implies hounds who
<span class="pagenum">{59}</span>
<i>hunt hares only</i>, in contra-distinction to those who
hunt either <span class="smcap lowercase">STAG</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">FOX</span>. Harriers have been produced
from the crosses between the beagle and the
fox hound, for the advantage of speed; but <i>harriers</i>
are not, in sporting acceptation, to be considered
synonymous with <i>beagles</i>, to whom they are very
superior in size. <span class="smcap">Mr. Daniel</span>, in a recent publication,
called "<i>Rural Sports</i>," has given an account
of "a cry of beagles, ten or eleven couple, which
were always carried to and from the field in a large
pair of panniers, slung across a horse: small as
they were, they would keep a hare at all her shifts
to escape them, and often worry her to death. The
catastrophe (says he) attending this pack of hounds
is laughable, and perhaps is a larceny <i>unique</i> in its
attempt. A small barn was their allotted kennel,
the door of which was one night broke open, and
every hound with the panniers stolen; nor could
the most diligent search discover the least trace of
the robbers or their booty."</p>

<h3>BEAK</h3><p>,—the bill of a bird, more expressively
understood in the "setting too" of a cock; which,
according to the articles and fixed rules of cocking,
must be "beak to beak."</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BEAM</h3><p>,—in the head of a deer, is the basis, or
part bearing the antlers, royals and tops.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3><span class="smcap">BEAT for a Hare</span></h3><p>,—is a term in hunting,
much less known, and much less used, formerly,
<span class="pagenum">{60}</span>
than of late years. When the huntsman was mounted
at <i>day break</i>, and the hounds were thrown off at
the place of meeting, as soon as the horsemen could
<i>see to ride</i>, the hounds took trail, and went to their
game in a style much better conceived than described.
No assistance was then required to <i>beat for
hares</i>, when the hounds were thus early enabled to
find for themselves. A chase (or two) was enjoyed
at that time, and the hounds at home in the kennel,
before the hour at which it is <i>now</i> the custom to
reach the field. Hence the custom of engaging
help to <i>beat for a hare</i>, the worst method that can
be adopted, and the most destructive of all discipline
with the hounds; for once accustomed to the
practice, heads are all up; and they are much more
employed in staring about, and listening for <i>a view
holloa</i>, than in putting their noses to the ground.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BEDDING</h3><p>—appertains here only to the bedding
of the horse, upon which there are such a variety
of opinions, that there cannot be the least expectation
of all ever centering in one point. While
some are profuse of straw at all seasons, even to a
degree of <i>waste</i> and extravagance, others, from a
parsimonious principle, do not (at least readily) admit
the necessity of <i>any at all</i>. In extremes, perhaps,
the line of mediocrity may be the most satisfactory,
and least liable to reprehension.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BETTING</h3><p>—is one great gratification of happiness
with the people of this country, who never
<span class="pagenum">{61}</span>
can be said to be <i>truly happy</i>, unless it is blended
with a <i>chance</i> of becoming completely <i>miserable</i>.
It is that kind of national <i>furor</i>, that no laws, however
<i>penal</i>, no restrictions, however <i>severe</i>, can have
sufficient force to stem the torrent of popular propensity;
particularly when nurtured and encouraged
by the prevalent example, and personal practice, of
the first and most exalted characters in the kingdom.
Experience has for ages proved it a privilege
implanted in the very hearts of its devotees,
which can only terminate when sporting propagation
ceases, and will of course continue to the <i>end
of time</i>. Legislative dictation, and magisterial authority,
may give a temporary check to games of
chance at tables of public notoriety, where the
most villainous depredations are in constant practice;
but so long as that excitement to the true
spirit of speculation, <i>a lottery</i>, the exhilarating power
of <i>a race</i>, the infectious clamour of <i>a cockpit</i>, or the
greater hobby-horse of John Bull, a <i>boxing match</i>,
is open to all minds, and in all directions, so long
will <i>betting</i> excite the attention, and continue to
constitute the pleasing, <i>painful</i> anxiety of pecuniary
speculation with the people of this country, (and
probably of every other,) from the highest to the
lowest classes of society.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Betting</span> is the act of laying a wager, or making
a deposit of money, by two persons of contrary opinions,
for one to become the <i>winner</i>, upon the decision
<span class="pagenum">{62}</span>
of some public or popular event; and that so
fashionable a mode of terminating disputes may
meet with but little difficulty or obstruction, <i>bets
are made</i> with as much deliberation, and discharged
by the <span class="smcap lowercase">SPORTING WORLD</span> with as much integrity, as
the most important transactions of the commercial
part of society in the first city of the universe.
Betting has of late years been reduced to <i>a system</i>,
by which there are now many <i>professors</i> in existence,
who were originally of the <i>very lowest order</i>;
but, by an indefatigable and persevering <i>industry</i>
at Newmarket, the cockpit, and the gaming
table, have acquired princely possessions, by the
unexpected honour of being admitted to princely
association. Where two opponents deposit <i>each</i> an
<i>equal</i> sum (whether five pounds or five hundred)
upon any event whatever, it is then termed <i>an even
bet</i>. An offer of <i>six</i> to <i>four</i>, implies the odds in
direct ratio of six pounds to four, twelve to eight,
sixty to forty; or in that proportion to any amount.
Betting <i>two</i> to <i>one</i>, is laying ten pounds to five,
twenty to ten, and so forth; one depositing exactly
<i>double</i> the amount of his adversary's <i>stake</i>; three,
four and five to one being regulated in the same
way. The latter are all termed <i>laying the odds</i>,
which vary according to the predominant opinions
of the best judges upon the <i>probable</i> termination of
the event; one rule being invariable, the person
betting <i>the odds</i> (or, in other words, the <i>larger</i> sum
against the <i>smaller</i>) has always the privilege of taking
<span class="pagenum">{63}</span>
<i>his choice</i> in preference to his adversary,
against which no appeal can ever be made with a
decision in its favor.</p>

<p>Any person proposing <i>a bet</i> to another during
the running of a horse, the fighting of a cock, or
any other transaction, the party applied to, saying
"done," and the proposer <i>replying</i> "done" also,
it then becomes a confirmed <i>bet</i>, and cannot in
sporting etiquette and honour <i>be off</i>, or revoked,
but by mutual consent. No bet above <i>ten pounds</i>
can be sued for and recovered in our courts of
law; the payment of all losings above that sum
must depend entirely upon the <i>sporting integrity</i> of
the parties concerned.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BISHOPING</h3><p>—is an operation performed upon
the teeth of a horse, and supposed to have derived
its <i>modern</i> appellation from an <i>eminent</i> and <i>distinguished</i>
dealer of the name of <span class="smcap">Bishop</span>; whether from
any peculiar neatness in, or reputed celebrity for,
a personal performance of the deception, it is most
probably not possible (or necessary) to ascertain.
The purport of the operation is to furnish horses
of <i>ten</i> or <i>twelve</i> years old with a <i>regeneration</i> of
<i>teeth</i>, bearing the appearance of <i>five</i> or <i>six</i>, and is
thus performed. The horse being powerfully
twitched by both the nose and the ears, a cushioned
roller (large enough to keep the jaws extended) is
then placed in the mouth; which done, the teeth of
<span class="pagenum">{64}</span>
the under jaw are somewhat reduced in their length
(according to their growth) by the friction of a
whitesmith's cutting file: an engraver's tool is then
employed in taking away as much from the centre
of the surface of each tooth as will leave a conspicuous
cavity in the middle; this cavity (or rather
every individual cavity) is then burned black with
an iron instrument red hot, and adapted to the purpose;
a composition of cement is then insinuated,
so well prepared in both colour and consistence, that
it is frequently not discoverable (at least to slight
observers) for many months after its introduction.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BITCH</h3><p>—is the feminine of the canine species,
in contra-distinction to dog. It is sometimes used
in a similar sense with respect to foxes, where the
female is termed <i>a bitch fox</i>; though a <i>vixen</i> is the
more sportsman-like appellation. Bitches are
sometimes <i>spayed</i>, to prevent their farther propagation:
it requires judgment and expertness in the
operation, the best time for which is about a week
after the heat is gone off.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BITS</h3><p>—are of different kinds, formed of iron,
and constitute the mouth-part of bridles of every
denomination, whether in carriage harness, or for
use on the turf, in the chase, or upon the road. The
single large-mouthed bit, first used with colts in
breaking, is known by the name of <i>mouthing-bit</i>:
the same shaped bit, but of a much smaller size,
<span class="pagenum">{65}</span>
with a small cheek of about three inches long, is
called a <i>piped cheek snaffle</i>. A single bit, having <i>a
curb</i>, and a cheek of five or six inches long, with
one rein only, and that inserted to the bottom of
the cheek, is termed <i>a hard and sharp</i>, and with
justice; it is one of the worst inventions ever
adopted, never seen in use with a sportsman, and
only calculated for vicious <i>run-away</i> horses, not to
be stopped by any common means. A bit of the
same form, having eyes for two reins, one on each
side the mouth-piece, and others at the lower extremity
of the cheek, are called <i>pelhams</i>, as a favourite
bit of the old Duke of Newcastle. A <i>bridoon</i> is a
small snaffle, or mouth-piece, having no other
cheek than a circular eye to receive the rein into
the same headstall, with which is stitched a roller-mouthed
<i>polished port bit</i>, having a cheek of four,
five or six inches in length, according to fancy, or
the mouth of the horse: the rein to this bit is affixed
to the lower extremity of the cheek, and, in
conjunction with the bridoon, constitutes the double
reined bridle, called <i>a Weymouth</i>, mostly in use.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BITES</h3><p>—frequently happen to sporting dogs as
well as to horses, but much more frequently to the
<i>former</i>, by poisonous insects that are, as well as
many not known. Means of relief must of course
be regulated by immediate appearances: in great
inflammation, <i>bleeding</i>, and external emollients, are
of good effect: in bites of the <i>viper</i>, its own fat liquified,
<span class="pagenum">{66}</span>
and to be had at the medical shops as the
"oil of vipers," is acknowledged a certain antidote.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BITTERN</h3><p>—is a bird of similar formation to
the <i>heron</i>, but of much smaller size, and more
beautifully variegated in its plumage. They are
principally found in sedgey moors, where they breed,
particularly within a few miles of the sea-coast, not
being very common in the centrical parts of the
kingdom. If brought down by the gun with only
<i>a broken wing</i>, they display great courage in opposing
their destroyer; possessing such determined
power, and quick exertion of both <i>talons</i> and <i>beak</i>,
they cannot be with safety secured till deprived of
life. From their scarcity, they are esteemed a
rarity at the tables of the great, where <i>one</i> is received
as a handsome present; a brace being seldom
seen together, either dead or alive.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BLACK ACT</h3><p>—is so called, because it was
enacted in consequence of the most unprecedented
depredations committed in Essex by persons in
disguise, with their faces blacked and disfigured,
and is literally thus.</p>

</div>

<p>"By this statute it is enacted, that persons, hunting armed and
disguised, and killing or stealing deer, or robbing warrens, or stealing
fish out of any river, &amp;c. or any person unlawfully hunting in His
Majesty's forests; or breaking down the
<span class="pagenum">{67}</span>
head of any fish-pond; or killing of cattle; or cutting down trees; or
setting fire to house, barn, or wood; or shooting at any person; or
sending letters, either anonymous, or signed with a fictitious name,
demanding money, &amp;c. or rescuing such offenders, are guilty of felony
without benefit of clergy." This is commonly called the Waltham Black
Act, and was made perpetual by 31 George II. c. 42.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BLACK-LEGS</h3><p>—is the expressive appellation
long since given by the superior classes of the sporting
world (consisting of noblemen and gentlemen of
fortune) to the very <i>honorable</i> and very <i>distinguished</i>
fraternity who are known to constitute "a
<i>family</i>," and are, perhaps, without exception, the
most unprincipled and abandoned set of <i>thieves</i>
and <i>harpies</i> that ever disgraced civilized society.
They are a body, existing by, and subsisting upon,
the most villainous modes of deceptive depredation:
their various modes of attacking, and preying upon,
the credulity of the inexperienced and unsuspecting
part of the public, are beyond conception: their
number is incredible, and their stratagems exceed
description. Destitute not only of character, but
of every sense of honor, their minds are destined
solely to the purposes of determined devastation upon
the property of those unthinkingly seduced or
betrayed into their company; upon whose credulity
and indiscretion they are supported in a continued
scene of the most luxurious and fashionable dissipation.</p>

</div>

<div class="pagenum">{68}</div>

<p>As members have no great power in exerting
themselves with much success individually, <i>the firm</i>
(if a phalanx of the most infamous combination
can be termed so) are adequate to almost every
desperate undertaking, from <i>pricking in the belt</i>,
<i>hustling in the hat</i>, or <i>slipping a card</i>, to the <i>casually</i>
meeting a <i>friend</i> upon Hounslow Heath. They
are sole proprietors of the different gaming tables,
public and private, as well in the metropolis, as
the <i>hazard</i> and E O tables at all the races of eminence
in the kingdom. They are invariably present
at every fashionable receptacle <i>for sport</i>: the
tennis-court, the billiard-room, the cockpit, have all
to boast a majority in <i>quest of prey</i>; and even the
commonest coffee-house is a spot where <i>modest
merit</i>, in the form of a lounging emissary, frequently
obtrudes, in the anxious hope of picking up
some opulent juvenile, that he may afterwards
enjoy the pleasure of introducing him in the most
friendly and liberal way to another member of the
fraternity, as a very proper object, or <i>pidgeon</i>, well
worth plucking for the benefit of the family.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BLADDER</h3><p>—is a part of the horse liable to disease;
but seldom known to occur, unless by the
indiscretion of the owner. A long retention of
urine, by continuing a journey to too great an extent
without stopping, may produce <i>strangury</i>; and
that not being soon relieved, inflammation may ensue.
Instances are recorded of stones, calcareous
<span class="pagenum">{69}</span>
substances, and different concretions, having been
found in the bladders of horses after death. <i>Discretion</i>
is a proper and cheap preventative.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BLANK</h3><p>—was a horse in high form, beating
almost every horse of his time, and his blood was
held in the utmost estimation: he was bred by
<span class="smcap">Lord Godolphin</span>; foaled 1740; got by the Godolphin
Arabian, dam by Bartlett's Childers, out
of the dam of the Large Hartley Mare. The various
performances of <span class="smcap">Blank</span> will not admit of
being brought within the compass of so concise a
description; therefore, suffice it to say, that, after
his performances upon the turf, he became a stallion
of the first celebrity, and was sire of <i>Ghost</i>,
<i>Tripod</i>, <i>Chatsworth</i>, <i>Hengist</i>, <i>Croney</i>,
<i>Yeoman</i>, <i>Porsenna</i>,
<i>Lottery</i>, <i>Young Blank</i>, <i>Lustre</i>, <i>Lumber</i>,
<i>Whipster</i>, <i>Amazon</i>, <i>Britannicus</i>, <i>Charlotte</i>,
<i>Prussia</i>, <i>Helen</i>, <i>Lycurgus</i>, and a very long list of excellent
runners, too numerous for insertion under this
head.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BLEEDING</h3><p>—of horses is a simple and easy
operation, hitherto performed with an instrument
called a <i>fleam</i>, which being steadily supported over
the neck vein (about five inches below the superior
process of the jaw-bone) is forcibly struck with
what is professionally termed <i>a bloodstick</i>, turned
out of the wood called <i>lignum vitæ</i>, as being sufficiently
heavy to insure weight and certainty to
the blow: the blade of the <i>fleam</i> is supported by a
<span class="pagenum">{70}</span>
shoulder, to prevent the incision's being made beyond
the depth of safety: the use of <i>the line</i> round
the lower part of the neck, previous to the operation,
is now greatly out of use; although it is certainly
a means of keeping the vein firm from <i>fluctuation</i>,
and of course a very proper guide, particularly
for young practitioners. Of late years this
mode of operating has greatly declined, particularly
with veterinarians of the <i>new school</i>, the most
expert of whom adopt the use of the <i>lancet</i>, and
are introducing it to general practice; and, although
the neatness of the operation must be candidly
admitted, yet, with high spirited, <i>shy</i>, <i>unruly</i>
horses, (where there is a chance of the point of
the lancet's being broken in the orifice,) a doubt naturally
arises, whether, <i>in such cases</i>, the former
method is not both the least troublesome and least
dangerous of the two.</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>consistency</i> and <i>propriety</i> of
<span class="smcap lowercase">BLEEDING</span> upon
slight or moderate occasions, has always been
matter of cavil and capricious controversy with
those whose cynical rigidity, and restless spirit, ever
prompts them to take even the <i>wrong side</i> of any
argument, (however absurd and ridiculous,) rather
than want a cause <i>to carp</i> at; but with those possessing
the power of scientific disquisition, and practical
professional knowledge, such fallacious and
ill-founded reasoning must fall to the ground. Its
utility, upon the attack of <i>almost every disease</i> to
<span class="pagenum">{71}</span>
which the animal is subject, is now so generally admitted,
that it stands in need of no additional corroboration
from the more refined rays of constantly
increasing improvement.</p>

<p>The quantity proper to be taken away at one
time, in any case, may be from <i>three</i> to <i>five</i> pints;
the latter only in such disorders as require plentiful
<i>depletion</i>: in all cases of inflammation (particularly
the lungs) frequent repetitions are to be justified,
provided they follow not too fast upon each
other; the lives of many horses have been preserved
(particularly in those <i>influenzas</i> of late years
called "the distemper") by <i>four</i> or <i>five</i> plentiful
bleedings in so many days; and, <i>vice versa</i>, as great
a number lost by a want of the same means. As
blood is generated, and the unloaded vessels replenished,
by the constant supply of <i>aliment</i> in <i>health</i>,
or <i>nutriment</i> in disease, so little, or, in fact, no
permanent injury can be sustained by leaning
to the <i>safe side</i>, and taking away even too
much, provided it be at different times, particularly
when it is remembered, that the life of a
valuable horse is very frequently lost by a too
great pusillanimity and forbearance in the operation.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BLEMISHES</h3><p>—are so called which constitute
disfiguration and eyesore, without impediment to
<i>sight</i> or <i>action</i>; it is therefore readily conceived, a
<span class="pagenum">{72}</span>
horse may be very materially <i>blemished</i> without
being unsound. Blemishes are various, and many
of them not to be immediately perceived, in a
superficial survey of the subject: <i>broken knees</i> are
a very material and conspicuous blemish: <i>splents</i>,
if large, are unpleasing to the eye of the good
judge and nice investigator: <i>warts</i> are easily observed,
and as <i>easily cured</i>: <i>thrushes</i>, and a carious
state of the <i>frogs</i>, not to be known but by an
examination of the feet: <i>sandcracks</i>, previously
cured, sometimes remain unseen, but are always
liable to a renewal of the original defect: the
marks of former <i>blistering</i> is, in general, to be
plainly perceived by a variation in colour, or an
unnatural roughness in the hair of those parts: the
marks of <i>firing-irons</i> may be easily traced (however
neatly performed) upon the <i>hocks</i> for <i>spavins</i> and
<i>curbs</i>, or upon the back of the shank-bones for
<i>strains</i> in the <i>back sinews</i>. A horse may be blemished
by a speck in the eye, arising from a blow
with the lash of a whip or switch; this is frequently
no more than a partial thickening of a
small part of the outer humour of the eye, not
obstructing those rays of light which constitute
vision.</p>

</div>

<p>If a horse is warranted "<i>perfectly sound</i>, without
<i>blemish</i>, free from <i>vice</i>, steady to <i>ride</i>, and
quiet in <i>harness</i>," it is a full and general warranty
speaking for itself; leaving very little for the intentional
<span class="pagenum">{73}</span>
purchaser to do (in respect to <i>inspection</i>) if
he has previously <i>tried</i> and approved the <i>paces</i> of
the horse. But where a warranty <i>seemingly guarded</i>,
or <i>cautiously partial</i>, is offered, a proper degree
of circumspection will be necessary to prevent a
chance of early repentance; a prevention of litigation
will prove less expensive than the <i>cure</i> of a
<i>lawsuit</i>.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BLINDNESS</h3><p>—in a horse (whether in one or
both eyes) may originate in a variety of well-known
causes, many of which are occasioned by means of
violence, and may at all times be prevented by
proper care and humane attention. If a horse,
having naturally good eyes, is observed to undergo
a <i>sudden</i> change in the external appearance, from
enlargement of the lids, or a discharge of hot
watery serum, with a visible <i>heat</i> and <i>pain</i> of the
part, (the horse constantly shaking his head and
ears,) it may reasonably be attributed to some
cause originating in external injury: if not by such
means, it must be from some morbid affection in
the system, acting more immediately and powerfully
upon the most irritable parts.</p>

</div>

<p>The eyes of some horses are periodically affected,
even for months and years, before they
terminate in <i>total blindness</i>: to this species of ocular
defect, the illiterate and less enlightened of
former times gave the appellation of "<i>moon-blind</i>,"
<span class="pagenum">{74}</span>
under the weak and ridiculous idea, that such
changes were produced by the gradational stages of
the moon; an opinion too trifling to render animadversion
necessary, it being one of the very few
remaining traits of superstition which will speedily
be totally done away. Many horses lose their eyes
from extreme exertion, as by <i>over racing</i>; in
proof of which, a very long list of instances
might be adduced: the same effect has been produced
upon <span class="smcap lowercase">STALLIONS</span> in being permitted to <i>cover</i>
mares not only in an unlimited degree in respect to
number, but stimulated so to do by the use of
powerful and prejudicial provocatives: in both
these cases the loss of sight is occasioned by a total
subversion of the nervous system, reducing it to a
fixed or partial debility of those particular parts,
from which they never recover.</p>

<p>Horses are frequently found to inherit constitutional
defects from <span class="smcap lowercase">SIRE</span> or <span class="smcap lowercase">DAM</span>; and none are,
perhaps, to be considered more justly hereditary
than <i>defects</i> of the <i>eyes</i>; and to render such fact
the more extraordinary, it generally happens to
have lain dormant for the first three or four years,
and never to display itself to any visible inconvenience
till a colt is broke, and brought into work.
The eyes of a horse inheriting this taint by hereditary
transmission, are much less prominent than a
natural, well-formed and good eye; they have a
kind of indented furrow in the lid above the orb,
<span class="pagenum">{75}</span>
and a wrinkled contraction in the part immediately
over that, constituting a kind of "vinegar aspect,"
better conceived than described: this kind of eye
should be carefully avoided in purchase; for however
they may vary by changes in work, and a diversity
of seasons, they, <i>nine</i> times out of <i>ten</i>, terminate
in blindness; a circumstance fairly to be
presumed, no professional man living can prevent.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BLISTERING</h3><p>—is an operation performed upon
a horse by unguents prepared of different degrees
of strength, according to the circumstances
of the case. They are in general use for blood
and bone spavins, curbs and strains of the back
sinews: where they do not complete the purpose
for which they were intended, they are repeated
at a proper period; or <i>firing the part</i> is adopted,
and the horse is turned out. Blistering is in general
too soon resorted to as a remedy, and in many cases
before the inflammation arising from the original injury
has sufficiently subsided for the operation to
take place; from which injudicious mode of practice,
a permanent enlargement of the part is occasioned,
that is never got rid of during the life of the horse.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BLOOD</h3><p>—is the well known fluid issuing from
wounds, or separated vessels, in an accidental destruction
of parts: it is not only the very <i>basis</i>, but
the <i>support</i>, of life <i>itself</i>; and drawn from the frame
of any animal beyond a certain proportion (professionally
<span class="pagenum">{76}</span>
ascertained,) causes <i>instant</i> death. In
the regular routine of the animal œconomy, blood
is generated by the frequent supplies of nutritive
aliment, and retaining within itself sufficient strength
and power for its <i>own peculiar</i> purposes, throws off,
by the different emunctories, the superflux with
which it may be encumbered: but as medical or
anatomical disquisition is not intended in a work of
this general kind, it must suffice to observe, that,
from the blood in its original and first formed
state, proceeds all the progressive and superior
functions of Nature. From the blood issues every
gradational proportion of insensible, sensible and
profuse perspiration; from the blood, the <i>urine</i> is
secreted (or separated) by the <i>kidnies</i>; and from the
blood is extracted, by the <i>genitals</i>, that very masculine
semen, by which (we are told from high and
indisputable authority) our posterity is to be continued
to the end of time.</p>

<h3>BLOOD HOUNDS</h3><p>.—Those so called, have
always had a kind of fabulous property ascribed to
them, of pursuing, and infallibly taking or seizing,
<i>robbers</i>, <i>murderers</i>, or <i>depredators</i>, whenever they
could be laid upon the footsteps (or scent) of the
particular object they were intended to pursue;
and of their possessing <i>this</i> property there can be no
doubt, when the experience of ages, transmitted to us
by our predecessors, (as well as our own observations,)
have afforded the most indisputable proofs, that
<span class="pagenum">{77}</span>
hounds may be taught or broke in to <i>carry on any
particular scent</i>, when <i>feelingly</i> convinced they are
to hunt <i>no other</i>. There requires no "ghost from
the grave" to confirm a fact of so much notoriety:
a mere <i>sporting embryo</i> would tell us, that "a pack
who for some years hunted <i>fallow deer</i> in the possession
of their last owner, are hunting <i>hare</i> in high
style with the present; that the principal body of
the celebrated pack who for some years past hunted
<i>fox</i> with <span class="smcap">Lord Darlington</span> in the <i>north</i>, are
now probably destined to the pursuit of the <i>red deer</i>
with <span class="smcap">Lord Derby</span> in the <i>south</i>: and the whole
art of changing hounds from one chase to another
is the temporary trouble of breaking them afresh,
and making them <i>steady</i> to the <i>scent</i> they are to
pursue."</p>

</div>

<p>In respect to the received opinion of what were
formerly called <i>bloodhounds</i>, the fact is simply this:
the original stock partook, in nearly an equal degree,
of the large, heavy, strong, boney old English
stag-hound, and the deep-mouthed <i>southern</i>
hound, of which mention is made under the head
"<span class="smcap">Beagle</span>." The hounds destined to one particular
kind of business or pursuit, as <i>bloodhounds</i>, were
never brought into the chase for a constancy with
the pack for the promotion of sport, but were preserved
and supported (as a constable or Bow-Street
runner of the present day) for the purposes of pursuit
and detection, whenever they could, with certainty,
<span class="pagenum">{78}</span>
be laid on <i>in good time</i> upon the scent of
footsteps of the object it was thought expedient to
pursue. <i>Deer stealing</i>, for instance, was so very
common a century since to what it is at present,
that the <span class="smcap lowercase">GAME</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">PARK</span> keepers in most parts of the
kingdom were in a kind of eternal watching and
<i>nocturnal warfare</i>: the hounds we are now describing
were then constantly trained to the practice, and so
closely adhered to the scent they were once laid on
upon, that (even after a very long and tedious pursuit)
detection was <i>certain</i> and <i>inevitable</i>: from this
persevering instinct and infallibility, they acquired
the appellation they have so long retained; and an
offending criminal not a century since, was absolutely
conceived to be <i>positively</i> taken, and <i>half convicted</i>,
the very moment a blood-hound could be
obtained.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BLOOD SPAVIN</h3><p>—is a preternatural and
puffy enlargement on the <i>inside</i> of a horse's hock,
proceeding from a distension of the vein crossing
the internal junction of the inferior part of the thigh
bone with the superior part of the shank; and whenever
such injury is observed, it may rather be supposed
to have originated in <i>a blow</i>, <i>a kick</i>, or more
probably from a ligamentary twist or distortion,
(by a short and sudden turn in the <i>small stall</i> of an
ill constructed stable,) than by any continued exertion
of speed, either on a journey or in the chase.</p>

</div>

<div class="pagenum">{79}</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BLOWS</h3><p>—inconsiderately given, in <i>passion</i>, to
harmless, inoffending animals, are nineteen times
out of twenty productive of repentance, when probably
repentance comes too late. A horse sometimes,
and most commonly from the inattention of
the rider, steps almost unavoidably upon a flint or
rolling-stone; and in the very exertion of recovering
himself from <i>nearly falling</i>, he at that critical
moment receives a severe and unexpected blow <i>behind
the ear</i> from the stick of his <i>philosophic, patient,
humane</i> rider, which brings him instantly to the
ground, giving and receiving ample proof, that
"the remedy was worse than the disease." No
conjectures need be formed upon the <i>loss of eyes</i> annually
sustained by blows from petulant masters, as
well as the most rascally servants; injuries of this
kind may be daily seen by observers with their <i>eyes
open</i> in every part of the kingdom.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Blows</span> will most assuredly sometimes happen
from <i>accident</i>, though most of this description arise
from folly, ignorance, or indiscretion; as for instance,
the very common circumstances of carelessly
giving a horse's <i>head</i> or <i>eye</i> a blow against the stall in
turning, or the <i>hip-bone</i> very frequently against the
post of the stable door, and this by the stupidity of
those who <i>seem to think</i> a horse can turn within as small
a space as themselves; or rather, perhaps, by those
who seem unfortunately destined by Nature <i>never
to think at all</i>. In general, the good or bad usage
of servants to horses, or other animals under their
<span class="pagenum">{80}</span>
care, may be conceived a very fair and unerring
criterion of the depravity or integrity of their <i>own
hearts</i>; and such should be emphatically told, that
not only <i>broken bones</i>, but instantaneous <i>loss of life</i>,
has frequently followed passionate blows, and cruel
usage, by the law of retaliation, in the resentment
of an animal capable of distinguishing between a
fault committed, a reproof given, or any unjust injury
sustained.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BONE SPAVIN</h3><p>—is an ossified enlargement on
the <i>outside</i> of, and rather below, the centre of the
hock, originating in a cartilaginous protrusion from
the seat of articulation becoming progressively callous,
and lastly a substance equally firm with the
bone itself. They do not invariably constitute
lameness upon their <i>first</i> appearance, but it soon
follows a course of hard or regular work. Blistering
<i>first</i>, and <i>firing</i> afterwards, was the practice of
farriers of the old school, which it is not known
has undergone any change with veterinarians of the
new.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BOLTING</h3><p>.—When a fox, laying at earth, has
been dug to, and, upon the approach of the spade,
the terrier, or the person attempting to take him,
makes a sudden spring, and <i>goes off</i>, he is then said
<i>to have bolted</i>; when, of course, the chase is continued
with the hounds. The term is also applicable
<span class="pagenum">{81}</span>
to a rabbit from its burrow, or the badger from
his earth.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BORING</h3><p>;—one of the former <i>humane</i> operations
in farriery for what is now called a lameness,
then termed <i>a wrench</i> in the shoulder: it consisted
in making a small orifice, or superficial incision,
through the integument near the part affected: into
this is insinuated a small tube or pipe; by the operator's
breath through which the part is inflated,
directly in the way a butcher swells his veal: a flat
piece of iron, of small dimensions, is then introduced
between the ribs and the shoulder in different
directions, to produce some effect hitherto unexplained,
and never understood. The seeming cruelty,
and evident uncertainty, of the operation, has
long since buried it in oblivion, at least with scientific
practitioners; and it is very little seen or heard
of, except amongst the rustic Vulcans in remote
corners of the kingdom.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BOTTS</h3><p>—are differently described by different
writers; a certain proof many of them wrote more
from <i>theory</i>, <i>copy</i>, and <i>hearsay</i>, than from attentive
practice, or personal observation. Some have observed,
they were of one shape; a second, of another;
a third has said their seat was invariably upon
one <i>particular part</i>; but the present Author has told
you, in his former Works, and now repeats the fact,
that they are equally inhabitants of the <i>stomach before</i>,
<span class="pagenum">{82}</span>
as they are of <i>the rectum</i> behind; and are as
constantly found in the former after the death of
the subject, as they are seen adhering to the sphincter
of the rectum during his life; and that horses,
who have fallen victims to the ravages of these destructive
diminutives, had both the stomach and
rectum loaded with numbers in a degree to be fairly
concluded <i>incredible</i>, unless the proof had been
personally confirmed by sight and individual conviction.
The mode by which they are conveyed
into the body (or how they are engendered there)
may possibly long continue a matter of conjecture
and ambiguity: Not so with <i>the effect</i>; when there,
they soon continue to increase, and to occasion
constant disquietude; sometimes violent pain. A
horse labouring under their persecuting pinchings,
is frequently eating, and without appetite, in a
hope of relieving himself from the <i>gnawing sensations</i>
within: he is generally rough in the coat, low
in flesh, depressed in the stable, and not elated when
out. Various remedies are in use; but mercurial
physic is the only certain mode of extirpation.</p>

<h3>BOWEL-GALLED</h3><p>—is a laceration occasioned
by the tightness and heat, or friction, of the girths,
just behind the elbows of the fore legs, and is soon
hardened and obliterated by two or three applications
of a soft sponge, impregnated with common
vinegar.</p>

</div>

<div class="pagenum">{83}</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BOWLS</h3><p>—is a game played upon a fine smooth
grassy surface, either square, circular, or oblong,
used solely for the purpose, and called a
<span class="smcap lowercase">BOWLING-GREEN</span>.
The party may consist of two, four, six,
or eight, and is generally chosen alternately, after
tossing up a coin to decide who shall have the first
choice. The sides being selected, each player has
two bowls, which bowls have numerical figures,
thereby ascertaining to whom they belong. The
leader sends off a smaller bowl, called <i>the jack</i>, to
what distance he pleases, it being (by the toss) his
privilege so to do: this he follows with his first
bowl, getting as near the jack as possible: he is then
followed by one of the adverse party, the partner
of the first following, and so in rotation till all the
bowls are played; when as many of the bowls, on
either side, as are nearer to <i>the jack</i> than the <i>nearest</i>
on the opposite side, so many do the successful
party score that time toward the game, and so on
in succession, till one side or the other have won
the match. Sometimes great disappointment happens
in the play, when a ball laying very near <i>the
jack</i>, is removed to a distance by the hit of an adversary's
bowl, which remains nearer the jack than
the bowl it has driven away; this is called a rub,
and gave rise to the long-standing adage, "he that
plays at <i>bowls</i>, must expect <i>rubs</i>."</p>

<h3>BRAN</h3><p>—would not have been entitled to notice
in a work of this kind, had it not been in a certain
<span class="pagenum">{84}</span>
degree of conditional use with horses of different
descriptions, in sickness as well as in health. <span class="smcap">Bran</span>
is an article almost generally known to be the
coarser part of the skin or covering of the grain
called <i>wheat</i>, from the body of which <i>flour</i> is manufactured,
and <i>bread</i> made. With some people
(particularly in the country parts of the kingdom,
who are desirous of keeping their horses at little
expence) bran constitutes a principal part of their
food; in consequence of which, it becomes necessary
to advert concisely to its known effects. From
its nutritive property having been taken away, it
contains little more than the means of distending
the frame, without the generative quality of enriching
the blood, or contributing to the formation of
flesh. Not calculated to become a primary object
of support, it may in some ways be brought into
use as a collateral of utility. Horses belonging to
<i>bakers</i> and <i>mealmen</i>, who have been principally
subsisted upon this article, with the addition of a
few split beans, (or peas,) have become pursive and
thick-winded; then asthmatic; lastly, dull, heavy,
and inactive; dying at nine or ten years old; when
a large ball, or <i>mealy concretion</i>, (of different sizes
in different subjects,) has been found in the stomach
or intestinal canal, of a most impenetrable
hardness, to the weight of ten or twelve pounds.
Though not proper for food in its dry state, it is a
most useful article in mashes with <i>malt</i>, to disunite
and prevent the satiating richness of that article
<span class="pagenum">{85}</span>
alone; or to assist in common mashes with oats,
(when a horse is in physic,) as well as to incorporate
with a proper impregnation of honey in the
mashes for colds during the severity of the winter
season.</p>

<p>"On the 15th of November, 1799, died, after
having been disordered some days, a horse belonging
to Mr. Ransom, of Hitchin. The cause of his
death was owing to a substance found in his stomach,
of a brown colour, exactly resembling a large
pebble stone, very smooth and hard on the surface,
and weighed 11 lbs. 14 oz. avoirdupoise. It is nearly
spherical, and measures just two feet in circumference,
being about the size of a man's head. It is
supposed to have been occasioned by his eating of
<i>bran</i>, that having been his constant food."—<span class="smcap">Sporting Magazine.</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">BREAKING the Herd</span></h3><p>—is the ceremony of
<i>singling</i> out a deer (either stag or hind) from the
herd for the chase, which is thus performed with
His Majesty's establishment in <span class="smcap">Windsor Forest</span>.
A survey being made of the herd, and the particular
deer fixed on for <i>separation</i>, the huntsmen, assisted
by one of the yeomen prickers, ride at a
hunting rate, gallop directly into the herd, continuing
so to do (as the herd divide) at the <i>particular
part</i> to which the deer intended to be singled
out continues to adhere. This ceremony is sometimes
a very tedious business to the men, as well
<span class="pagenum">{86}</span>
as to the horses, as it is no uncommon thing, when
they have detached, or reduced a <i>divided</i> part of
the herd to a leash or two brace, (amongst which
is the particular deer wanted,) for that number to
make a circle of ten, fifteen, or even twenty miles,
before the riders, with all their energy, can disunite
them more than to a single <i>brace</i>, and not at
all to a <i>single deer</i>. When this is effected, the
hounds, who are in waiting at some distance,
under the six remaining <span class="smcap lowercase">YEOMEN PRICKERS</span>, are
<i>capped forward</i>, and laid upon the scent; when
the brace finding themselves pursued, soon <i>divide</i>,
under the impression of individual safety; and the
selected deer being thus completely <i>singled out</i>, the
chase goes on, and continues till the deer is taken;
unless, after a pursuit of proper length, for the
sport of the day, he should regain the herd, where
he is then permitted to remain, and the hounds
are drawn off: but if it is either an <i>old hind</i>, or
<i>a calf</i> destined to <i>death</i>, for the purpose of <i>blooding
the hounds</i>, a repetition of the original ceremony
of separation takes place, when which is effected,
the chase is immediately renewed till the object of
<i>blood</i> is attained.</p>

<h3>BREAST-PLATE</h3><p>,—an article in horse furniture
of great utility with light carcased horses, who
very frequently, in both hunting and racing, <i>run
through their girths</i>. It is made of either spring web
or soft leather, as most agreeable to taste or fancy,
and is fastened by buckles to small loops screwed to
the tree of the saddle, just under the upper saddle-flap
behind the withers of the horse; from whence
the two parts divide transversely, and one passes
down each shoulder to the point of the breast, where
they are united to a strong strap, having holes, a
buckle and loop, through which loop one of the
girths is passed when the saddle is put on, and being
thus fixed, it is considered almost an impossibility

The methods of bringing up colts vary according

for the turf, field, draft, or road. The breeders
of opulent magnitude in the northern counties,
most celebrated for the breed of horses in Britain,
are too well skilled in the practical part to require
the least aid from theoretic instruction. They are
well convinced, by the unerring principle of well-founded
experience, that sound <i>sires</i>, well shaped
dams, good summer care, and <i>winter keep</i>, are
<span class="pagenum">{88}</span>

<h3>BRIDLE</h3><p>,—the well-known article by which

and temper of the horse; consisting of <i>snaffles</i>,

<h3>BROKEN WIND</h3><p>—remains in its long-standing
state of professional ambiguity; for, notwithstanding
frequent dissections must have afforded
<span class="pagenum">{89}</span>
every assistance to earnest investigation, yet no authenticated,
well-established opinion has transpired,
sufficiently attracting or corroborative to fix a criterion
upon which scientific or public faith seem inclined
to rely. Since the appearance of "The
Gentleman's Stable Directory," (about fourteen
years since,) a great variety of veterinary <i>writers</i>,
and veterinary <i>practitioners</i>, have emerged from
obscurity in the metropolis, as well as in different
parts of the kingdom. One has defined <i>broken
wind</i> to be "an inflammation, which continuing
a length of time, throws a quantity of extravasated
blood into the <i>windpipe</i>, where it occasions a kind
of <i>roaring</i>": this was the opinion of an eminent
veterinarian, delivered upon a <i>horse cause</i> tried before
Lord Kenyon in the court of King's Bench.
In this sublime description there certainly appears
no <i>brilliant</i> or satisfactory elucidation. A recent
writer says, "Broken wind is a disorder that a horse
is subject to when he is suffered to stand too long
in the stable without exercise; by which means he
contracts gross and thick humours in such abundance,
that, adhering to the hollow parts of his
lungs, they stop his windpipe." So much for the
"sublime and beautiful." A third attributes it to
"a relaxation or rupture of the phrenic nerves,
which cause the motions of the diaphragm." A
fourth <i>supposes</i> "the disease to proceed from a <i>morbid</i>
or obstructed state of the glands, and membranes
of the head and throat, the enlargement of which
<span class="pagenum">{90}</span>
prevents a free passage to the wind." Doctor Darwin,
speaking of humoural asthma, attributes it to
"a congestion of lymph in the air cells of the lungs,
from defective absorption."</p>

</div>

<p>Others, <i>harping</i> upon the <i>same string</i>, constitute
an echo of <i>nearly</i> the <i>same sound</i>: "In my ideas,
a redundance of lymph being thrown upon the
lungs, the quantity becomes too great for the capacity
of the absorbent vessels; hence it stagnates,
and choaks up the air conduits; and the theatre of
its action being more confined, of course respiration
must be more difficult and laborious." All
which divested of the transposition of words, is the
opinion of the present writer, promulgated in his
Stable Directory, "that the disease originated in a
sizey state of the blood, which at length becoming
viscid and stagnant, occasioned obstructions in the
first instance, lastly <i>tubercles</i>, by which respiration
became imperfect, and one or both lobes of the
lungs inadequate to the execution of their office."
However <i>literary speculators</i> may differ in either
opinion or description, no great diversity of opinion
can happen upon the subject of relief; <i>palliation</i>
may be obtained; perfect <i>cure</i> must <i>not be expected</i>.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BROOD</h3><p>,—a word almost indiscriminately used
for the young of <i>any fowl</i>. There is, however, a
much nicer and more sporting-like distinction. To
speak properly, we say, a <i>brood</i> of ducks, a <i>clutch</i>
<span class="pagenum">{91}</span>
of chickens, a <i>setting</i> of gulls, a <i>covey</i> of partridges,
and a <i>nide</i> of pheasants.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

purpose of breeding colts, and put to no other use
whatever.</p>

<h3>BROW ANTLER</h3><p>—the first <i>branch</i> from the
<i>beam</i> in the head of a stag.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BUCK</h3><p>—the male of the fallow deer. In his
first year he is called <i>a fawn</i>; he is then <i>a pricket</i>;
and lastly <span class="smcap lowercase">A BUCK</span>. In colour they are mottled,
sandy, or a deep dingy brown, approaching to
black. The males have horns; the does none.
Buck venison is very superior to doe; and when
well fatted, sells from <i>three</i> to <i>four</i> guineas <i>each
haunch</i>. The season for it in the highest perfection
is from June to September.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Buck hunting</span>—has been of late years but
little practised, very few of them affording chase
enough to render it a matter of much sporting attraction;
particularly if bred in a park, whence,
from its being so much accustomed to the sight of
the human frame, it becomes in some degree like a
kind of domestic animal. They were much hunted
by the <i>late</i> and great (<i>Culloden</i>)
<span class="smcap">Duke of Cumberland</span>;
but with his hounds (called buck hounds)
he drew for and roused his outlying deer in <i>Cranbourne Chace</i>,
<span class="pagenum">{92}</span>
near <span class="smcap">Windsor Great Park</span>. When
found in this way, they frequently went away well
across the country, and sometimes afforded tolerable
sport. The bucks shed their <i>horns</i> (called heads)
annually in April or May, which, with the skins
of both <i>bucks</i> and <i>does</i> killed within the year, (if a
park is large,) make no inconsiderable perquisite to
the keeper.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>BULL DOG</h3><p>.—A bull dog, though inoffensive
and harmless when properly domesticated, forms,
to the eye of timidity, a most terrific appearance:
the doubtful and designing leer of the eye, the
tiger-like shortness of the head, the under-hung
jaw, the wideness of the forehead, the width of the
skull, the distension of the nostrils, and the almost
constant sight of the teeth, hold forth a very emphatic
specimen of the power they possess, when
that power is <i>angrily</i> brought into action. The
breed is by no means so numerous as formerly,
in consequence of the gradual decline of bull-baiting,
and the great number taken abroad, for
many of which very great prices were obtained.
The natural ferocity, strength, and thirst for blood,
in this animal, rendered them a formidable nuisance
in their unrestrained state, and they are now seldom
seen at their full liberty, either in town or country;
the owners, from a proper fear of the law, finding
it more prudent to keep them properly confined.</p>

<h3>BULL-BAITING</h3><p>—was formerly not merely a
pleasing pursuit, but an <i>extatic diversion</i>, of the
most unfeeling, and least humane, part of the very
lowest, and most abandoned, orders of the people.
To such a pitch of prevalence had it arrived in
some particular parts, and was so much considered
to give additional callosity to the minds of its cruel
and inconsiderate abettors, that the more polished
and humane classes of society made strong and repeated
efforts for its <i>total abolition</i>, by endeavouring
to obtain an act of the Legislature for that purpose;
which, however, unluckily failed of the intentional
effect; for the bill being rejected by a very
trifling majority in the House of Commons, it left
the sport at the full liberty of every <i>subject to enjoy</i>,
who is not restrained by any more humane, sublime
and manly sensations of his own, prompting him
to believe it "more honoured in the <i>breach</i> than
the observance." The towns of <i>Stamford</i>, in <i>Lincolnshire</i>,
and <i>Wokingham</i>, in <i>Berkshire</i>, are now,
perhaps, the only places of any note where the sport
(as it is called) is obstinately persevered in, or <i>enthusiastically</i>
and <i>annually repeated</i> by the clamours
of those unfeeling advocates for <i>custom</i>, who, in
the language of Shylock, claim "it as a right, and
will not be deprived of it."</p>

</div>

<p>The first bull-bait in this country is supposed to
have been at Stamford, in the year 1209, in the
reign of King John, and at Tutbury, Staffordshire,
<span class="pagenum">{94}</span>
in 1374. The introduction of it at Stamford
was as follows.</p>

<p>"William, Earl Warren, Lord of this town, standing upon the walls of the
castle, saw two bulls fighting for a cow in the castle meadow, till all
the butchers' dogs pursued one of the bulls (madded with noise and
multitude) clean through the town. This sight so pleased the Earl, that
he gave the castle meadow, where the bull's duel began, for <i>a
common</i> to the butchers of the town, after the first grass was mowed,
on condition that they should find a <i>mad bull</i>, the day six weeks
before Christmas-day, for the continuance of that sport <i>for ever</i>."</p>

<p>"George Staverton, by will, dated May 15, 1661, gave the whole rent of
his dwelling-house at Staines, after two lives, to buy a bull annually
for ever; which bull he gave to the poor of the town of Wokingham, to be
there <i>baited</i>, then killed, and properly divided; the offal, hide,
and gift money, to be laid out in shoes and stockings to be distributed
among the children of the poor. The alderman and one Staverton (if one
of the name should be living in the town) to see the work done
<i>honestly</i>, that one of the poor's piece did not exceed another in
bigness."</p>

<p>These seem to have been the principal donations
upon which the practice was originally founded,
and afterwards continued upon the plea of <i>charity</i>
for its justification. To give it a degree of singularity
<span class="pagenum">{95}</span>
in the town of Wokingham, St. Thomas
(21st. Dec.) is the <i>day</i> dedicated to the <i>sport</i>, and
the market-place the <i>spot</i> destined to the <i>sacrifice</i>.</p>

<p>Let the reflecting mind indulge one moment in
awful rumination upon the dreadful scene and
"note of preparation." On a day when every
well informed mind, and duly disposed heart, must
feel inclined to follow the dictates of religious inculcation;
when a certain impressive silence pervades
the whole; when the devout, the aged, and
the infirm, await the signal by which they are summoned
to receive every comfort and consolation
from clerical benediction; it must be to all good
hearts a mortifying circumstance, that the very bell
which tolls to bring the moral and religious part
of the inhabitants to their duty in the church, is
also the signal for bringing a poor, harmless, unoffending
animal (<i>with his chain</i>) <i>to the stake</i>. Incredible
it must seem to those who have never witnessed
the cruelty of the scene, that this very stake
is fixed (and called the bull-ring) in the center of
the market-place of a market town no more than
<i>twelve</i> miles from the seat of Majesty, and <i>thirty</i>
only from the metropolis of this great and enlightened
kingdom.</p>

<p>Without enlarging much upon the "hellish
practice" of the <i>sport itself</i>, it cannot be inapplicable
to advert one moment to the effect a scene of
<span class="pagenum">{96}</span>
so much insatiate cruelty must inevitably produce
upon the growing offspring of the lower classes,
in towns where a custom so generally execrated is so
shamefully carried on. Previous to the commencement,
"every heart beats high with the coming
joy;" not a window but is crowded with women
and children; not a street, or an avenue, but is
crowded with <i>brutes</i>; the very scum and refuse of
society from every part of the surrounding country;
and then begins a scene of the most cruel and infernal
practice that ever entered the heart of man,
under the appellation of <i>sporting mirth</i> to the multitude.
In the church of this town, on Sunday,
the 20th day of December, (being the day previous
to the baiting of the bull,) 1801, a sermon was
preached by the Rev. Doctor Barry, which sermon
is since published, and where the following passages
may be found.</p>

<p>"Gracious God! benevolent Parent of the universe, what a prodigy must he
be in a Christian land, who could thus disgrace his nature by such
gigantic infamy, at which the blood of a heathen, of a very Hottentot,
might curdle! Two useful animals, the bull, who propagates our food, and
the faithful dog, who protects our property, to be thus tormented! and
for what purpose? Does it tend, as some have said,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_2" id="Ref_2" href="#Foot_2">[2]</a></span>
to keep alive the spirit of
<span class="pagenum">{97}</span>
the English character? In answer to this we must remark, that the
barbarous sport (if sport it can be called) was unknown to the ancient
bravery of our ancestors; was introduced into this country in the reign
of a <i>bad</i> king; and earnestly do I pray to Almighty God, that in
the reign of a most pious and benevolent Prince, it may be <i>for ever
set aside</i>! Cowards, of all men the least unmoved, can both inflict
and witness cruelties."</p>

<p>"The heroes of a bull-bait, the patrons of mercenary pugilists, and the
champions of a cock-fight, can produce, I should think, but few, if any,
disciples brought up under their tuition, who have done service to their
country either as warriors or as citizens; but <i>abundant</i> are the
testimonies which have been registered at the <i>gallows</i> of her
devoted victims, trained up to these <i>pursuits</i> of
<span class="smcap lowercase">BULL BAITING</span>!!!"</p>

<p>Thus much upon its morality: now to a description
of its practice. The bull being chained to the
stake, which chain extends to about fifteen yards
in length, and terminates in a very strong leather
collar passing round the neck of the bull; and his
horns having been previously muffled at the points
(by the professional amateurs) with a composition
of <i>tow</i>, <i>tallow</i>, and <i>melted pitch</i>, the ceremony thus
commences. Those <i>gentlemen</i> best calculated to
appear in the character of <i>desperados</i> begin the attack
<span class="pagenum">{98}</span>
by the most dreadful noises of different kinds,
<i>bellowings</i>, <i>hootings</i>, and <i>hissings</i>, consisting of a
complication horrid beyond description. Whilst
the abandoned crew of <i>raggamuffins</i> are in this way,
with their <i>hats</i> and <i>huzzaings</i>, endeavouring to irritate
him <i>before</i>, if the poor animal, partially submissive
to his fate, remains unmoved, seeming (in
the "mind's eye" of rumination) to say "I stand
here an object more <i>sinned</i> against than sinning," it
rouses the infernal malice of the multitude to a
certain degree of indignation, which is instantly
displayed by the confederates <i>behind</i>, who being
mostly provided with sharp-pointed sticks, proceed
to those <i>pleasing punctures</i>, and provoking <i>twists</i> of
the <i>tail</i>, which rouse him from his state of humiliation
to a temporary madness; when, in the midst
of this horror and confusion, the <i>first</i> dog is suddenly
<i>let loose</i>: and this, to the <i>treble refined</i> and
inexplicable sensations of a bull-baiter, is the <i>most
extatic</i> moment of his life; his very existence is absorbed
in the magnitude of the concern; his whole
soul is engaged; the mind or memory is no longer
itself, and the tormentor is as completely <i>mad</i> as the
unfortunate object of his persecution.</p>

<p>The scene now advances to a state of confusion
exceeding all <i>humane</i> conception; the howling of
the dogs, still in hand, anxious and eager to be let
loose; the roaring and dreadful bellowings of the
bull, (particularly if pinned by the nose to the
<span class="pagenum">{99}</span>
ground;) the dangerous pressings, and incessant
hollowing and huzzaings of the <i>mob</i>; the galloping
<i>tramplings</i> of the enraged animal; all constitute a
scene from which the thinking mind retreats with
horror, and claims a chasm to renew the description.
The first dog, perhaps, inadequate to the
wishes of his adherents, and not being able to succeed
farther than to increase the rage of the bull,
is assisted by a <i>second</i>, which instantly rousing the
victim at the stake to an encreased exertion of rage
and self defence, as evidently increases the <i>horrid
happiness</i> of the multitude to a degree beyond
all power of imagination, and to which the
descriptive pen must bow obedience, and acknowledge
its <i>inability</i>.</p>

<p>Should the poor persecuted animal, by every
strenuous effort in its own defence, collect sufficient
strength to keep its two inveterate foes <i>at bay</i>, and
preserve its nostrils from the blood-thirsty fangs of
its opponents, delay does but increase the determination
of those previously determined; in which
case resentment is seldom long without a remedy.
Stimulated to a greater degree of cruelty by tedious
disappointment, a <i>third dog</i> (should it be necessary)
is let loose, <i>as it were by accident</i>, to assist the other
<i>two</i>; when, under so severe a weight of accumulated
oppression, exhausted nature sinks; the poor
pitiable object is <i>pinned</i> to the ground by the most
irritable and tender part about him, bleeding and
<span class="pagenum">{100}</span>
bellowing amidst the shameless shouts of a shameful
victory, where five hundred greater brutes have
brought a lesser to the ground.</p>

<p>Not to prolong so shocking a description beyond
the length unavoidably necessary to its perfect comprehension,
it must suffice to say, the cruelty is extended
by every means that can possibly <i>assist the
cause</i>. Prizes are annually advertised for the best
dogs, thereby inducing the owners to bring them
any distance, not only to increase and lengthen the
sport, but that the <i>object</i> of <i>misery</i> may not die too
<i>easy</i> a <i>death</i>! In the midst of his sufferings, if the
minds of his hellish tormentors have not been sufficiently
satiated with repetitions of what has past,
collateral aids are called in to rouse his powers (already
by an unwearied scene of persecution lulled
to an apathy) of defence and resentment once more
into action. Instances are common where fires
have been made under the very body of the bull,
when too much worn down, and exhausted by the
jerks of the chain, longer to exert himself; patiently
he stands, with the blood streaming from his
nostrils, totally insensible to the twistings of his tail
even to dislocation, the continued goring with
sticks pointed with nails, and a long list of experiments
equally to be abhorred, only tend to
strengthen, most incontrovertibly, the dreadful effect
such scenes (exultingly enjoyed) must have
upon the rising generation, whose minds must, by
<span class="pagenum">{101}</span>
a familiarity with the frequency of the scene, be
rendered totally callous to every sensation of tenderness
and humanity, even in the very hour of infantine
infatuation.</p>

<h3>BULL RUNNING</h3><p>—is a pursuit of the bull in
a way no less cruel and disgraceful to the humanity
of this enlightened country than what has been before
described. By custom in the manor of Tutbury,
in Staffordshire, as mentioned at almost the
head of the last article, a bull was given by the
prior to the minstrels. After undergoing the torture
of having his horns cut off, his ears and tail
cropped and docked to the very stump, his nostrils
filled with pepper, and his body besmeared with
soap, he was turned out in such a pitiable state to
be hunted, (this was called <i>bull running</i>;) and when
taken, or held long enough to pull off some of <i>his
hair</i>, he was then fastened to the stake, and <i>baited</i>.
To the great honour, however, of the Duke of
Devonshire, (Steward of Tutbury,) and not less so
of the people who petitioned against it, the <span class="smcap lowercase">BULL RUNNING</span>
at <i>Tutbury</i> was entirely abolished in the
year 1778.</p>

<h2>C.</h2>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CADE</h3><p>—was a horse of the best <i>blood</i>, <i>speed</i>, and
<i>bottom</i>, ever bred in the kingdom. He was foaled
in 1734; got by the <span class="smcap">Godolphin Arabian</span>; dam
(Roxana) by the Bald Galloway. He beat most
horses of his time, and was afterwards, as a
<span class="smcap lowercase">STALLION</span>,
the sire of <span class="smcap">Changeling</span>,
<span class="smcap">Matchem</span>, <span class="smcap">Young Cade</span>,

<i>et ceteras</i>; through the channels of whose different
progenies his blood is to be found in almost every
stud of celebrity from one extremity of the kingdom
to the other.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CADENCE</h3><p>,—divested of its mere technical idea
in the manege, is, in horsemanship, what <i>time</i> is in
<i>music</i>, uniformity in manners, or consistency in
conduct: a horse complete in his <i>cadence</i>, is to be
considered perfect in his action.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CALKING, or <i>Corking</i></h3><p>,—is the projecting part
erroneously formed at the <i>heels</i> of horse-shoes in
general, particularly in frosty weather; at which
time their utility may be admitted, and, in fact,
cannot be <i>done without</i>, where horses are in frequent
use. These calkings, however, cannot be justified
upon any scientific principle whatever, without
<span class="pagenum">{103}</span>
chance of accident to the rider, and of lameness to
the horse; for upon level ground the horse cannot
move but in a distorted motion; and if the prominence
in the shoe comes into immediate contact
with a rolling-stone, or a projecting part in the
pavement, ligamentary lameness probably ensues.
If it is found necessary to bring them into use at
all, <i>even in frosty weather</i>, both heels should be
equally raised, as there will be much less danger in
a double than a single calking.</p>

<h3>CALOMEL</h3><p>—is a medical article, well known
by this name as the mildest preparation of mercury:
it is in general use in private practice, and a certain
specific for the obliteration of <i>worms</i> in
<span class="smcap lowercase">HORSES</span>,
when added in proper proportions to the ingredients
for purging-balls.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CAMPHIRE</h3><p>—is a vegetable concrete, unctuous
to the touch, with a fragrant smell, somewhat like that
of rosemary, and a bitter pungent taste, accompanied
with a sense of coolness on the tongue. It is
volatile, like essential oils, but without their acrimony:
it burns in water; it receives no empyreumatic
impressions; nor does it suffer any resolution
from any degree of fire, to which it can be exposed
in close vessels, though readily combustible in the
open air. Camphire is known to be good, if, when
it is put upon hot bread, it becomes moist; if dry,
it is bad. It should be kept in a glass stopper
<span class="pagenum">{104}</span>
bottle, or close tied in a bladder, not more to prevent
it from losing its property, than to prevent
the loss of the whole by exhalation. Used as a medicine,
internally or externally, it has a narcotic
effect, and greatly diminishes the irritability of the
system; as an external, it is singularly useful, particularly
in weakness, rheumatic pains, or spasmodic
affections.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CAMPHORATED SPIRITS</h3><p>—is a prescription
standing in the Dispensatory of the London
College of Physicians, and is thus prepared.
"Take of camphor two ounces; rectified spirit of
wine, one quart; shake frequently till the camphor
is dissolved." It is a very useful embrocation in
slight strains, as well as to prevent the breaking of
chilblains in the winter season.</p>

fomentations, that no good sportsman in the country

<h3>CANKER</h3><p>,—a diseased state of the foot of a
horse, originating in a neglected thrush, which
having acquired a corrosive property by its retention,
continues to rot and destroy the surrounding
parts, till, by a judicious separation of the fungus
from the sound parts, fresh granulations may be
promoted, and the cure confirmed.</p>

</div>

<div class="pagenum">{105}</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CANKER</h3><p>—in the ear of a dog, is mostly occasioned
by injury from bushes in beating or hunting
covert, and might be easily cured at first with a
little Friar's balsam, or tincture of myrrh: this
being omitted, a rigid eschar forms upon the surface,
when which is separated by accident (as it repeatedly
is) it leaves the wound larger than before.
A very slight touch with the <i>butter of antimony</i>, is
the surest and best mode of destroying the foundation
of inveteracy, and healing the wound.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CANKER</h3><p>—in the mouth of a horse, invariably
proceeds from an injury sustained from severe and
improper jerks of the bridle by the passion and petulance
of the rider: in the seat of the wound or
laceration, is formed a sort of insensible slough,
which either a little burnt alum, or borax powdered
fine, and sprinkled upon the surface, will soon separate,
and bring away: the part will afterwards promote
its own cure.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CANTHARIDES</h3><p>.—Spanish flies, the principal
ingredient in every composition prepared for the
purpose of blistering; some of which are in the
form of ointments; others, less powerful, are applied
as liquids, and called liquid blisters.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CAPARISON</h3><p>—is mostly used as a military
term, appertaining to cavalry regiments, and applicable
to the apparatus of every individual; the

saddle, bridle, housings, holsters, and trappings, of

<h3>CALF</h3><p>—is the male produce of the <i>stag</i> and
<i>hind</i>: they are the largest of the species in England,
and known in the aggregate by the general appellation
of <span class="smcap lowercase">RED DEER</span>; these are mostly the natives
of forests and chaces, (as Windsor and the New
Forests, Sherwood, Enfield Chace, &amp;c.) in contra-distinction
to <i>fallow deer</i>, bred in parks, and called
<span class="smcap lowercase">BUCK</span> and

<h3>CALLS</h3><p>—are instruments for imitating the call
of partridges and quails; some of which are so admirably
executed, that, with those who are adepts
in the execution of the plan, and the management
of the nets, it becomes a pleasing, if not a profitable,
amusement.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CAPON</h3><p>;—a young cock divested of his testes
(by incision and separation) so soon as he is large
enough for the operation: the best time is at about
three or four months old. The only useful intent
is to acquire additional size and growth, as capons
are frequently killed of seven, eight, and even <i>nine</i>
pounds weight.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CARP</h3><p>—are esteemed one of the richest fresh
water fish we have in the kingdom: they are the
principal stock of park canals and manor ponds,
<span class="pagenum">{107}</span>
to the owners of which they afford considerable
profit; particularly near populous cities, where
they can be disposed of to advantage at the season
when such ponds are drawn, and new stocked with
stores. Much success depends upon the nature of
the soil where the pond is situate: if in a soft marley
kind of earth, or warm clay, impregnated
with hazel earth, and a muddy bottom, they thrive
beyond expectation; but upon a dead, black,
moory gravel, or a flinty, chalky bottom, they
are sterile beyond description, in both growth and
propagation. They are a fish so exceedingly shy,
(or so exceedingly cunning,) that they afford very
little success to the angler, who ought to be one
of the most patient adventurers that ever embarked
in sporting speculation. They are but little found
in running streams or rivers, notwithstanding very
large quantities of small stores are constantly thrown
in from the reservoirs and breeding ponds of gentlemen
living in the vicinity of such rivers, not
more to get rid of their own superflux, than to
promote a friendly supply for the accommodation
of their neighbours. In large ponds, well stocked,
the <i>poachers</i> are never deficient in means of procuring
themselves <i>a share</i>: this they effect by forming
a paste of crumbled bread, flour, and treacle,
to which they add some of the coculus indicus (an
Indian berry) in powder: this being well incorporated,
and thrown into the pond in various parts,
about the size of common baits, in the latter part
<span class="pagenum">{108}</span>
of the evening, the fish will be found at daylight in
the morning floating upon the surface in a state of
stupefaction, when they are taken out with the
hand close to the bank without the least difficulty.
This is a business carried on to a wonderful extent
for thirty and forty miles round London, in which
circle the <i>system</i> of <i>supply</i> is as regularly conducted
as the first commercial concern in the metropolis;
as will be seen when we come to a more minute
description of the <i>art</i> under the head <span class="smcap">Poaching</span>.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CARMINATIVES</h3><p>—are all such warm aromatic
seeds or medicines as expel wind, amongst
which may be justly ranked most of the spices;
likewise aniseed, carraways, cardamoms, ginger,
grains of paradise, &amp;c. They are excellent aids
in the flatulent disorders of horses; but should
not, if possible, have been too long <i>in the shop</i>, as
some of them lose their property by long keeping.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CARROTS—</h3><p>are, after the fair experiments of
late years, become an article of very considerable
consumption, as a collateral kind of food for the
support of horses employed in agriculture. The
most candid attention, and minute observation, at
length admits, that horses having a proportion of
carrots, washed, cleaned, dried, and cut either
alone, or mixed with the barn chaff, do their work
as well, look as firm in their flesh, and fine in their
<span class="pagenum">{109}</span>
coat, as those who are kept upon corn, chaff, and
hay. Although their utility in this way cannot be
denied, yet it must be remembered, they are not
sufficiently nutritious for horses in <i>hard</i> or <i>expeditious</i>
work upon the public and posting roads; they
require a more firm, substantial support: for horses
in easy, slow, and moderate work, they answer
well, incorporated with other articles; or even
alone, in small quantities; but if given <i>too largely</i>,
they attenuate the blood, and impoverish the frame.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CART HORSES</h3><p>.—The horses so called are
principally the horses employed in drawing farmers'
waggons, carts, and the plough; as well as the infinity
employed with waggons upon the turnpike
road, in the conveyance of articles in trade from
one part of the kingdom to another. The incredible
number supported in the metropolis, and
its environs, by the merchants, breweries, coal
merchants, carmen, and the proprietors of wharfs,
exceed the utmost conception of those not accustomed
to such prospects, or to such calculations.
Of cart horses this kingdom has to boast different
kinds, and those kinds are most judiciously appropriated
to the different work, and different countries,
for which they seem to be more particularly
or individually adapted. Great pains have been
taken, and no expence spared, to improve this peculiar
and most useful breed of horses to the utmost
<span class="pagenum">{110}</span>
possible pitch of perfection. The sorts mostly in
use, are the large heavy blacks, for which Leicestershire,
Lincolnshire, and the midland counties, are
the most remarkable; the little stout, uniform
<i>punches</i> from Suffolk; and some of the strong,
hardy <i>sturdies</i> from Clydesdale, in North Britain.
The former of the three sorts, when well shaped,
and uniform, constitute as perfect beauties to the
contemplative eye of the patriotic agriculturist, as
the best bred blood horses can possibly do to the
most enthusiastic admirer of the turf. From these
midland blacks of the largest size, strength, and
uniformity, are selected all the capital stock of the
most opulent firms and manufactories in and round
the metropolis. Those one degree inferior in
height, strength, uniformity, and price, constitute
the <i>bell teams</i> of the farmers in <span class="smcap">Berkshire</span>,
<span class="smcap">Hants</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Wilts</span>; at the principal market towns of which,
as <i>Reading</i>, <i>Wallingford</i>, <i>Abingdon</i>, <i>Basingstoke</i>,
<i>Alton</i>, <i>Alresford</i>, <i>Winchester</i>, &amp;c. may be seen some
of the strongest, handsomest and finest teams of
draft horses in the kingdom without exception.</p>

</div>

<p>The Suffolk punches are a considerably coarser
kind of horse, less uniform in shape, and less constant
in colour; they run greatly into a mealy chesnut,
or roan sorrel, having mostly a blaze in the
face, with a white mane and tail; they are very
staunch to their work, and the hardiest, perhaps,
of any horse brought into use. These qualifications
<span class="pagenum">{111}</span>
destine them to the possession of small farmers,
having the least money, and, in general, to
countries having the least keep. By the account
of a previous writer, they are entitled to a more
pre-eminent situation. He says, "they are nimble
walkers and trotters: they have ever proved themselves
the truest and best drawers in the world, as
well as the hardiest and most useful cart and plough
horses. Their nimbleness, it should seem, is owing
to their moderate size; and their immense powers
in lifting weight, to the same cause, combined with
the low position of the shoulder, which occasions
weight to be acted upon in a just and horizontal
direction. Their superiority over all other horses,
at drawing dead pulls, is, no doubt, in some measure
owing to early training, as in no county is
such pride taken in teaching horses to draw; and it
is well known, that a team of Suffolk horses, the
signal being given, will all down upon their knees,
and leave nothing behind them, that is within the
power of flesh and blood to draw away."</p>

<p>Of the Clydesdale or Scotch horses it is said,
"they are probably as good and useful a draft
horse as any we are possessed of; larger than the
Suffolk punches, being from fifteen to sixteen hands
and a half high; strong, hardy, and remarkable true
pullers; a restive horse being rarely found amongst
them. In shape, plain made about the head, sides,
and hind legs; mostly grey or brown; said to have
<span class="pagenum">{112}</span>
been produced from the common Scotch mare and
Flanders horses, a hundred years ago." The same
writer also recommends "the mixing a little racing
blood with the cart flock; enlarging also upon the
wonderful exertions in carting business upon the road
by the Cleveland bays, a sort of coach horses. Although
bred horses are, of all others, the most sluggish;
yet it is well known, that a <i>cross of their blood</i>
gives spirit and activity to the heavier kind of horses."</p>

<h3>CASTING NET</h3><p>.—In a half extended form,
(when in part suspended from the ground, and resting
on the leads fixed to its bottom,) it resembles a
bell in its shape; but when <i>cast</i> in the <i>water</i>, or
spread on the ground, it constitutes a complete
circle. They are made of different dimensions;
and so constructed, as to be completely grasped by
the right and left hand, having the centre of the
net spread over the left shoulder; when, by a sudden
exertion, (in which there must be great expertness,)
the net is so cast as to fall upon the water in
its <i>utmost circular extent</i>; where sinking with all
possible expedition, by the weight of the lead
affixed to its edges, which now becoming the bottom,
incloses within it all the fish in the space so
covered, and from whence no one can escape. To
the centre of the net is fixed a line of ten or twelve
feet long, which line, in throwing (or casting) the
net, is of course extended, the extremity being previously
fastened to the wrist: when the leads have
<span class="pagenum">{113}</span>
reached the bottom of the water, and rest on the
ground, the fish rise into the bell part of the net;
then the person having the line in hand begins to
draw the net gently to land; in doing which, the
edges approach each other at bottom, where there
are tucks to receive the fish; and those, particularly
<i>roach</i>, <i>perch</i>, and <i>gudgeons</i>, are sometimes caught
in great abundance. The person casting the net
should use a round frock, or a jacket without buttons;
for want of using which precaution, many a
sportsman of this description has received a complete
and dangerous ducking, to which he did not
seem to think himself fully entitled.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3><span class="smcap">CASTING the Hair</span></h3><p>;—an almost obsolete (or
provincial) term for a horse's shedding his coat.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CASTRATION</h3><p>—is the loss of the testicles by
extirpation, which requires a very nice eye, and
steady hand, in the operator: for, although it has,
in general, been performed by Vulcanians of the
inferior order, who are strangers to the delicate
structure and formation of the parts, yet it is now
to be anxiously hoped, we are fast emerging from
former ignorance, and that we shall become as expert
and dexterous in this art (if not so famous) as
the <i>Italians</i>. There are two modes of operation;
one of those not of long standing: the original
manner of operating was by first casting the horse
upon a bed of straw, properly prepared for the
<span class="pagenum">{114}</span>
purpose; then securing the testes by bandage, and
making an incision longitudinally through the
scrotum; laying bare the testicle, and, after making
firm a waxed thread around the spermatic cord,
the testicle was then extracted by the knife, and the
farther effusion of blood prevented by the hot iron,
or actual cautery. This is the method still in use
in most parts of the kingdom, and most probably
where the greater number of colts are bred; but in
the present increase of veterinarians, some verification
of the old adage, "New lords, new laws,"
must be expected; and they proceed in a different
way.</p>

</div>

<p>Presuming upon the possibility of the cauterized
eschar coming away by chance or accident, and the
profuse hæmorrhage that might probably follow,
before the apparatus could be again collected, and
the horse reduced to a proper position for securing
the arteries from a farther effusion of blood, the
following mode is now adopted. The horse being
cast, and the incision made through the scrotum, as
before described, the spermatic cord is then secured
by passing across it a slit stick up close to the
body, which is secured at each end with the waxed
thread used by shoemakers: this acting as a tourniquet
upon the artery, the separation and dissection
is then made with the knife; after which a few
pledgets, of warm digestives, are introduced; no
cautery at all applied; a trifling inflammation, with
<span class="pagenum">{115}</span>
consequent discharge, ensues; the superfluous parts
slough off, and ten days or a fortnight terminates
the whole.</p>

<p>In respect to the <i>age</i> and <i>season</i> most applicable,
and best adapted, to the operation, custom and experience
seem to have left no room for improvement:
twelve or thirteen months old is the best
time to perform the operation, and in the months
of <i>April</i>, <i>May</i>, or <i>June</i>, that either extreme of
heat or cold may be equally avoided. In the last
seven years, several practitioners of the new school
(to shew the superiority of <i>art</i> over
<span class="smcap lowercase">NATURE</span>) held
forth the theory of castrating horses of <i>any age</i>,
without the least confinement or rest, the subject
being permitted to go directly about his business as
usual. This proposition was too surprising, and
too alluring, not to obtain converts; numbers acquiesced;
theory was in a variety of instances reduced
to practice; and the practice soon proved
(to the mortification of the owners) the truth of the
adage, "Dead men tell no tales."</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CATARACT</h3><p>,—the technical term for a defect
of the eye, to which no particular <i>cause</i> of <i>origin</i>
has been yet decisively ascertained. The faculty
define it, "an opacity of the crystalline humour of
the eye, which prevents the rays of light passing to
the retina, and of course preventing vision." <span class="smcap">Doctor Hunter</span>
says, "it is when an inflammation in
<span class="pagenum">{116}</span>
the coat of the crystalline humour hath rendered it
opaque." But <span class="smcap">Mr. St. Yves</span> seems to be of
opinion that the crystalline humour swells. He
also divides the cataract into the <i>true</i>, the <i>doubtful</i>,
and <i>false</i>: the true he subdivides again into <i>three</i>;
the doubtful into <i>four</i>; and the false into the glaucoma,
and the shaking cataract. All this division
and sub-division seems little regarded even by the
most curious and indefatigable in anatomical researches;
particularly as it is much to be regretted,
that, with every professional and energetic endeavour,
no medicines, external or internal, have ever
been discovered, that are known certainly capable
of removing this disorder. In the human frame,
methods of operating on the crystalline humour
were successfully practised by <span class="smcap">Sharp</span>,
<span class="smcap">Daviel</span>, and
others: little, however, is to be expected with the
horse. In such case, perhaps, it may be "better
to bear those ills we have, than venture upon those
we know not of."</p>

<h3>CATHARTICS</h3><p>—are synonimous with purgatives,
and include all medicines of that description.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CAUSTICS</h3><p>—are medicines which externally
constitute a destruction of the texture (or superficies)
of the parts to which they are applied.
Caustics are of different kinds, and of various
powers, according to the reduction, or extirpation,
for which they are intended. The actual cautery,
<span class="pagenum">{117}</span>
or red-hot iron, is used in firing, as well as for the
farther prevention of sand-cracks already broke
out. The antimonial caustic, or butter of antimony,
(in judicious hands), is a complete and
perfect cure for <i>poll evil</i>, <i>fistula</i>, <i>quittor</i>, and <i>canker
in the foot</i>. Lunar caustic is an admirable counteraction
to warts, and fast-shooting fungus. Red
precipitate is an excellent substitute, when so much
strength is not required; few wounds in horses can
be brought to a favourable state of cicatrization
without it.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CAVESON</h3><p>—is an article used in the breaking
of colts, as well as in the manege: it consists of a
semi-circle, of iron or blocked tin, passing round
the nose, about five inches above the nostrils,
having three hinges or joints, concave on the inside,
and covered with leather, list, or woollen
cloth. This has three swivel rings, one in the
center of the noseband, and one on each side; to
all or either of which the reins are affixed, that he
may be accustomed, in the ring, to pace either to
the <i>right</i> or <i>left</i>. The caveson is mounted with a
headstall, somewhat similar to the headstall of a
bridle: and to the rings on each side the caveson,
are straps long enough to be buckled to the sides of
the saddle, that his head may be kept in a proper
position (when bearing upon the <i>colt's bit</i>) to render
him pliable, and to insure a good mouth.</p>

<h3>CHACE</h3><p>.—A chace is, in general acceptation,
considered a receptacle for game, interspersed with
<i>fern</i>, <i>thickets</i>, <i>underwood</i>, and probably with <i>small
coverts</i>, for its preservation. It is understood to
be superior to a park, but inferior to a forest,
having none of those laws for its protection. It is
not unfrequently the property of a subject, and is
then protected by its own manorial rights and privileges.
<span class="smcap">Chaces</span> there are, also, the property of
the <span class="smcap">Crown</span>; and those are generally regulated by
the <span class="smcap lowercase">FOREST LAWS</span>, as is the case with <i>Cranbourne
Chace</i>, situate in <span class="smcap">Windsor Forest</span>.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CHASE</h3><p>.—The chase, as well as other pleasures
of equal attraction, has had its most inveterate opponents,
as well as its equally determined devotees.
Various and vehement have been the declamations
against it; equally numerous, and equally energetic,
have been the expostulations in its defence. That
it was practised, and enthusiastically enjoyed, by
the ancients, as perseveringly pursued by the moderns,
and will be continued to the end of time,
(in opposition to every species of puritanical rigidity,)
will not admit of the least contrariety in
opinion. The <span class="smcap lowercase">CHASE</span>, taken in a general point of
view, includes the chase of every description, and
implies a pursuit of <span class="smcap lowercase">GAME</span> (or vermin) found in a
state of natural liberty, with a body (called a <i>pack</i>)
of hounds, who follow the object, whatever it may
be, by the <i>scent</i> left on the ground, (from which an
<span class="pagenum">{119}</span>
effluvia exhales,) so soon as the game thus found
may have <i>broke from their view</i>. Upon the subject
of <i>scent</i>, its origin, its duration, and its evaporation,
innumerable conjectures have been sported by
literary theorists; in opposition to the animadversion
upon which, much more might be introduced;
but as it must unavoidably terminate, like all other
matters of <i>hypothesis</i>, to which no criterion of certainty
can be produced, very little entertainment,
and no <i>positive</i> information, can be derived from the
investigation.</p>

</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap lowercase">CHASE</span>, in this its most comprehensive meaning,
implies <i>hunting</i> of <i>every kind</i>, whether <span class="smcap lowercase">STAG</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">FOX</span> or <span class="smcap lowercase">HARE</span>, (with either or all of which, <i>the otter</i>
is not of sport or magnitude sufficient to be put in
competition.) These three different kinds of chase
afford equal sport, but in a more distinct and different
way from each other; most admirably adapted
to the different inclinations, dispositions, and personal
sensations, of the various admirers who enter
into its spirit, according to the different stages of
life and gradations of age. <span class="smcap">Fox hunting</span>, it must
be admitted, is most applicable and exhilarating to
the fire and impetuosity of unrestrained juvenility,
or manhood more matured; where, perhaps, the
pleasure is enhanced only in proportion to the difficulties
of the day, upon the military principle of
"the more danger, the more honor."</p>

<div class="pagenum">{120}</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Stag hunting</span> may probably be more adapted
to the taste or prudence (or more appropriate to the
wishes) of the <span class="smcap lowercase">SPORTSMAN</span>, who having past the
meridian of life, has long since discovered the
<i>value</i> of <i>time</i>, and knows how to appreciate its
loss: he wishes to insure a chase of <i>two</i> or <i>three</i>
hours to a <i>certainty</i>, without employing perhaps
<i>double that time</i> before the game is <i>found</i>; with the
additional chance of exploring a dull and dreary
journey of fifteen or twenty miles home, in a dirty
country, with no other consolation, than a great
deal of riding, but <i>a blank day</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hare hunting</span> is, in the estimation of the sporting
world, held in a certain degree <i>inferior</i> to the
other two, (so far as hard riding and personal courage
is concerned;) because the exercise is not so
violent, nor is the chase of equal duration. Indeed,
strong advocates for <span class="smcap lowercase">STAG</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">FOX</span> hunting
hold this sport exceedingly cheap, and satirically
say, "it is better calculated for the initiation of <i>juveniles</i>,
the entertainment of <i>women</i>, and the amusement
of those gentlemen in the more advanced
stages of life, who, like the old woman in the farce,
is highly pleased with the <i>sound</i> of the <i>fiddle</i>,
though no longer <i>able to dance</i>." Hare hunting,
however, though not so attracting to those who wish
to recount the difficulties, the toils and vicissitudes
of the day, after a long chase, yet to the contemplative
mind of reflection, much more of the <i>minutiæ</i>
<span class="pagenum">{121}</span>
of <i>hunting</i>, and the instinct of animals, is to
be enjoyed than in either of the other two: of this
most probably ample proof will be adduced, when
they come to be separately enlarged upon under their
different heads.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CHALLENGE</h3><p>—is a term used for the first
<i>tongue</i> of a hound after throwing into covert, to
draw either for <i>fox</i>, or an <i>out-lying deer</i>. Upon the
<i>challenge</i> of a single hound, if he is staunch, and
to be relied on, a general silence ensues; ears are
all open for a repetition, and every eye for <i>a view</i>;
the huntsman (who well knows how far to depend
upon the truth of the declaration) instantly encourages
the pack to the promised point, by "<i>hark</i>
to <i>Gamboy</i>!" "<i>hark</i> to <i>Galloper</i>!" or whatever may
be the name of the favourite hound so to be relied
on. The hounds by this means are immediately
rallied to the precise spot, and ready to go off in a
body with their game, as a <i>lucky find</i> frequently follows
an unexpected challenge; more particularly
in the present fashion of going to covert, at a time
of day when our predecessors of only one generation
past used to return.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CHAFFING</h3><p>,—so called, is a loss of hair, and
laceration of the skin, by the pad of the saddle
having got too hard in the stuffing from constant
use, and for want of timely circumspection. It is
also frequently occasioned by the extreme heat and
<span class="pagenum">{122}</span>
friction, in continuing to travel <i>very long stages</i> in
the hotter months, without more frequent relief or
rest to the horse. This is a very common fault, or
act of indiscretion, with the mechanical part of the
community; who possessing rather too much of the
<i>spirit of trade</i>, anxiously endeavour (in the extent
of their sagacity) to do much more, in less time,
than nature ever intended, by <i>humanely</i> travelling
a horse <i>two stages</i> instead of <i>one</i>, thereby saving
most arithmetically one half the expence, upon the
city principle of Old Philpot, that "a penny <i>saved</i>,
is a penny <i>got</i>."</p>

</div>

<p>There cannot be a more prudent precaution in
either sportsman or traveller, than an occasional
inspection of the <i>stuffing</i> of the <i>saddle</i>, which invariably
gets hard with constant use: it should
sometimes be beat and softened with a stick, afterwards
lightly raised in every part with the point of
a packing needle, and made smooth and free from
lumps upon the surface, by which means every
chance of injury will be avoided. Nothing can
be productive of more anxiety than a sore back of
the horse, either to the traveller on his journey,
or a sportsman in the field; or any thing more mortifying,
than to recollect such injury originated in
the <i>neglect</i> of the <i>master</i>, and not in a fault of the
horse. The backs of some well-bred and thin-skinned
horses, particularly young ones, are subject
to <i>chaffing</i> and <i>warbles</i> upon very slight occasions;
<span class="pagenum">{123}</span>
to counteract which, nothing can be better, more
simple, or more easily obtained, than two or three
table-spoonsful of the best white wine vinegar,
bathed cold upon the part, and that so soon as
the saddle is taken off, and while the pores are
open.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CHARGE</h3><p>—was a favourite part of former
practice in farriery, and consisted of compositions
in the form of an adhesive mass, which being
<i>plastered</i> upon the part afflicted, was there left <i>to
act</i> as a <i>corroborant</i>, an <i>emollient</i>,
a <i>discutient</i>, a <i>repellent</i>,
or, in fact, to effect any purpose intended,
or that the case might require. These preparations
were applied in different states, and were denominated
<i>hot</i> or <i>cold charges</i>, according to the
mode in which they were laid on. As, however,
no great proofs of their efficacy were ever established,
or any authenticated records of their utility
known, they seem to have glided out of modern
practice, and been totally superseded by the more
rational introduction of penetrative stimulants, in
fomentations, embrocations, &amp;c. which come into
more immediate contact with the affected parts,
where injury has been sustained.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CHEST</h3><p>—is the part of a horse comprehended
in the side view, from his wither to the bottom of
his ribs near the elbow, at the upper part of the
fore arm; and is perfectly understood, when we
<span class="pagenum">{124}</span>
say, "that horse is well let down, and deep in the
chest." If, in addition to this, he is "round in
the barrel," he may then be said to have a <i>good carcase</i>.
To judge well of the chest, it is necessary to
come before, and take a front view, if which is
broad, and the horse stands wide and firm, it is a
proof of strength; but if narrow in the breast,
(alias the chest,) he will not only be very likely to
cut before, but to become chest-foundered, if put
to any extraordinary exertions.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CHEST-FOUNDERING</h3><p>,—a debility in the
shoulders, chest and fore-quarters of a horse, seemingly
less understood, and certainly less explained
hitherto, than any one disorder or defect to which
the horse is incident. Those who have written upon
this subject, evidently <i>echo each other</i>; as they
literally and individually say, "it proceeds from
hard labour, whereby the horse becomes surfeited;
so that, upon the whole, it is no more than a severe
cold, and is to be managed accordingly." These
are, in fact, the very words of <span class="smcap">Bracken</span>, who precedes
it with this remark: "Most authors agree it
is so;" giving no opinion of his <i>own</i>, beyond its
originating in a "severe cold," and is to be "<i>managed
accordingly</i>." He says, "the signs are a staring
coat, and heaving of the flanks more than common."
That a chest-foundered horse may <i>happen</i>
to have a <i>staring coat</i>, or a heaving of the flanks,
from some different or <i>remote</i> cause, cannot be denied;
<span class="pagenum">{125}</span>
but that <i>either</i> of them are diagnostic symptoms
of chest-founder, no scientific practitioner will
ever admit.</p>

</div>

<p>A horse said to be chest-foundered, is almost invariably
contracted in the breast between the points
of the shoulders; becoming narrower there, as if
there was a <i>wasting</i> of those particular parts. If
you put him into a <i>trot</i>, he moves his legs one before
the other with great difficulty, as if they were
internally connected, and prevented farther extension
by two latent links of a chain. When pressed
to a gallop, the case becomes <i>instantly</i> decisive; he
labours to get his legs from <i>under him</i> without success;
a general constriction pervades the whole of
his fore parts; and his action may, with much
more propriety, be termed <i>jumping</i> than galloping.</p>

<p>Although no one author has given a proof he
ever bestowed an explanatory thought, or condescended
to transmit a single line, upon the <i>absolute
cause</i> of this very common defect, yet it by no means
seems sufficiently involved in ambiguity, to render
fair conjecture, or professional opinion, a matter of
the least difficulty. As the disorder is invariably
fixed upon those subjects who have done the <i>most
expeditious</i> and <i>constant</i> work, without having been
ever known to affect those who have done little or
none; so it is natural to conclude, the intercostal
and subclavian muscles must have sustained injury,
<span class="pagenum">{126}</span>
from the incessant vibrative concussions occasioned
by the almost eternal contraction and expansion of
those parts, in such labour as horses are put to who
become subject to the misfortune, which partakes
much more of oppressed nature than of disease. It
should seem, by the great number of horses (decidedly
chest-foundered) who experience evident relief,
and go with much less pain and difficulty, when
they have got warm, that the muscular parts acquire
rigidity when in a state of inaction, but expand,
and gradually throw off the stricture, so soon as
the circulation is encreased by action, and perspiration
produced; both which subsiding, the previous
stiffness returns. Let, however, what will be
the cause, (and upon which the best opinions may
vary,) instances are very rarely or ever known of
perfect cure, or complete eradication. Long rest,
by either a summer or winter's run, will always be
found productive of relief, and sometimes hold
forth a descriptive promise of permanence, which
very mild and gentle work may continue; but hard
riding, long journies, or severe labour, will always
produce a relapse.</p>

<h3>CHILDERS</h3><p>—was distinguished from <i>four</i> others
in succession of the same name, by the appellation
of the <span class="smcap">Devonshire</span>, or
<span class="smcap">Flying Childers</span>, having
been the <i>fleetest</i> horse ever bred or trained in this
kingdom, and said to have ran <i>a mile in a minute</i>.
The fact, however, was not so; he went the <i>fourth</i>
<span class="pagenum">{127}</span>
of a mile at the rate of a mile in a minute, and
beat every horse of his time with ease. He was bred
by <span class="smcap">Mr. Childers</span>; was foaled in 1715; and got
by <span class="smcap">Darley's Arabian</span>, dam (Betty Leedes) by
<span class="smcap">Careless</span>. He covered as a stallion, and was sire
of <i>Firetail</i>, <i>Blacklegs</i>, <i>Second</i>, <i>Plaistow</i>, <i>Snip</i>, and
<i>Commoner</i>; all good runners, particularly the first
three; also <i>Blaze</i>, <i>Winall</i>, and <i>Spanking Roger</i>;
horses of some note; as well as <span class="smcap">Lord W. Manners's</span>
<i>Poppet</i>, (an extraordinary runner at five

but very few mares, except the Duke of Devonshire's.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Childers</span>, commonly called <i>Grey Childers</i>, was

<h3>CHOLIC</h3><p>.—The disorder so called in horses, is
properly divided into two kinds, and should be
carefully attended to in the attack, before medicines
are administered in <i>one</i>, which might have
been more applicable in the <i>other</i>. One species of
cholic (which is the most common) originates in
a retention of confined air, from having been supplied
with too much <i>flatulent</i> provender, or too
much <i>water</i>, at an improper time. This disorder,
in general, soon submits to warm, cordial, anodyne
medicines, accompanied by friction and flank rubbing;
seldom terminating in death, though always
accompanied with symptoms of danger. The other
is produced by hardened fæces plugging up the intestinal
canal, and frequently proves fatal: the least
delay is dangerous, and too much expedition cannot
be used to obtain relief. In the "Gentleman's Stable
Directory," they will be found distinctly described,
and the mode of cure explained.</p>

the first <i>warm</i> weeks in <span class="smcap">February</span>, when the

said to be <span class="smcap lowercase">CLICKETTING</span>; or that at this particular
season they go to <span class="smcap lowercase">CLICKET</span>. After
<i>conception</i>, they
are said to be <i>knit</i>; when the <span class="smcap lowercase">DOE HARE</span>

<h3>CLYSTERS</h3><p>—are, in a variety of cases, and
upon many emergencies, so truly and so expeditiously
useful, (without the least danger of being injurious,)
that their salutary effects cannot be too
well known, or too generally understood. They
are differently prepared, from a decoction of the
aromatic garden herbs, as <i>marshmallows</i>, <i>camomile</i>
<i>flowers</i>, and <i>wormwood</i>, <i>gruel</i>, a handful of <i>salt</i>, and
half a pint of <i>oil</i>; or, indeed, from any of the prescriptions
with which books upon physic and farriery
are generally loaded. When prepared, and
of a proper warmth, they are gently conveyed into
the body through a wooden pipe, to which is fixed
a large bullock's bladder, containing the clyster to
be injected. The pipe having been previously
moistened upon the surface, with either sweet oil or
lard, is then insinuated within the sphincter of the
anus; when which is effected, the string hanging
from the bladder (and to the other end of which the
cork is annexed, that plugs up the internal mouth
of the pipe confined in the bladder) is steadily
pulled with the right hand, while the left is employed
in keeping the pipe in its proper situation,
and supporting the bladder with its contents: upon
the cork's being withdrawn, and a free passage
made for the clyster, the hands are pressed moderately,
and <i>in motion</i> upon the bladder, so as to
force the whole into the body; when which is done,
the pipe is gently taken away, and the effect of
course is waited for, or repeated, if necessary. The
<span class="pagenum">{130}</span>
mild and advantageous mode of obtaining relief by
<i>clysters</i>, is greatly preferable to the rough old method
of extracting the dung from the rectum by introducing
the hand, which is not only producing
unnecessary pain to the patient, but very frequently
of exciting inflammation. Every sportsman of
experience must know, that, upon all emergencies,
in <i>fever</i>, <i>cholic</i>, <i>strangury</i>, <i>inflammation</i> of the
<i>lungs</i> or <i>kidnies</i>, a clyster may be so soon prepared,
and so soon administered, (particularly in remote
situations in the country,) that no gentleman, anxious
for the safety and preservation of his <i>stud</i> or
<i>stock</i>, should be without such articles as would enable
him to adopt some extemporaneous means of
relief, till assistance (which is sometimes at a great
distance) could be obtained.</p>

<h3>COAT</h3><p>.—The coat of a horse (which the hair is
called) is not only an object of sporting exultation
when the horse is in fine condition, but, to the judicious
and penetrating eye, is in a great degree indicative
of the state of health. Nothing will so soon
demonstrate the <i>ability</i>, the <i>care</i> and <i>attention</i> of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">GROOM</span>, as the coat of his horse.
If the coat is observed
to become suddenly rough, standing different
ways, with a dusty hue underneath, and the hair to
look harsh and bristly upon the surface, the blood
is then sizey, and tending to an unhealthy state;
the porous system has been collapsed by some
chilling exposure to <i>wet</i> or <i>cold</i>; the integument
<span class="pagenum">{131}</span>
acquires a tightness and rigidity, which, if not relieved,
soon displays itself in some slight degree of
disease: this may, in general, be prevented, by taking
away blood, and proceeding upon a short
course of antimonial alteratives.</p>

<h3>COCKING</h3><p>—was formerly a sport so exceedingly
prevalent (from the great and perpetual variety
it afforded in <i>betting</i>) that matches were constantly
fighting between different counties, as well
as opulent individuals, and at most of the horse-races
in every part of the kingdom, for very considerable
sums of money. This practice, however,
like every other <i>species</i> of <i>sporting</i>, in the course of
time, opened so great a field for villainy amongst
the subordinates, who become unavoidably instrumental,
(as <i>feeders</i>, <i>setters-to</i>, and <i>assistants</i>,) that,
in addition to the incredible expence of <i>breeding</i>,
<i>walking</i>, <i>feeding</i>, <i>matching</i>, removing and carrying
cocks from one walk to another, collecting them
when brought up to fight, injuries sustained upon
their walks, consequent disappointments when taken
up, with a long train of collateral considerations,
have very much reduced both the <i>sport</i> and
the <i>breed</i> in every part of England.</p>

</div>

<p>When all the leading expences are brought into
one point of view previous to a <span class="smcap lowercase">MAIN</span>
of <span class="smcap lowercase">COCKS</span> being
placed in the <i>pens</i>, and the aggregate of expenditure
annexed to the <i>match money</i>, (then to be deposited,)
<span class="pagenum">{132}</span>
it plainly appears, that any man so fighting,
is doing it at a disadvantage of <i>two</i> to <i>one</i>
against himself. If he wins, he wins but the match
money; this, probably, may, or may not, even pay
his expence: if he loses, he has then lost both the
<i>deposit</i>, and his previous expenditure in <i>breeding</i>,
<i>feeding</i>, &amp;c. constituting <i>loss upon loss</i>; and if he
wins, he is no gainer, because the winning has been
absorbed in the predatory payments already described.
In fact, <span class="smcap lowercase">COCKING</span> then (divested of every
moral consideration in respect to its alledged cruelty)
is the most ungentleman-like, the least entertaining,
and the most doubtful in probable profit,
that any sportsman of honour and integrity can
possibly engage in: but as fashions continually vary,
and it may hereafter undergo a renewal, farther
particulars respecting the sport will be found under
the proper heads of <span class="smcap">Game Cock</span>, and

<h3>COCKNEY</h3><p>—is the distinguished appellation
by which those gentlemen are honoured, who,
being <i>natives</i> of the Metropolis, are supposed never
to have very far exceeded the vibrative limits of
<i>St. Paul's clock</i>, or <i>Bow bell</i>. The term, however,
well known as it is, would not have been entitled
to a place in this collection, had it not been thought
necessary to communicate to the sporting world, a
<i>derivation</i> so very little known. A citizen of the
above description making an excursion with his
<span class="pagenum">{133}</span>
son to the neighbourhood of Highgate, the lad (who
had never before <i>taken a journey</i> of such magnitude
and extent) happening to hear a horse neigh,
(which was quite <i>new</i> to <i>him</i>,) hastily exclaimed,
"How that horse <i>barks</i>!"—"Barks! you booby,"
replied the father; "<i>Neighs!</i> you mean. A <i>dog</i>
barks; a <i>horse</i> neighs!" They had not proceeded
far, when the youth, finding his ears assailed by the
sudden <i>crowing</i> of a <i>cock</i>, was so fascinated with the
shrill and unexpected sound, that he instantly attracted
his companion's attention with, "Hark,
father, how that <i>cock neighs</i>!" To which happy
effusion of fancy, citizens will probably stand indebted
for the name of cockney to the end of time.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>COCK-FEEDER</h3><p>—signifies a person whose occupation
it is to <i>collect</i>, <i>handle</i> and <i>feed</i> a pen of
cocks, to fight such main or match as may be made
or agreed on, by those who deposit the battle money,
and are called the <span class="smcap lowercase">MASTERS</span> of
the <span class="smcap lowercase">MATCH</span>.
These find or procure the cocks, of which the feeder
takes charge; and to his judgment is submitted the
entire management of <i>selecting</i>, <i>rejecting</i>, <i>feeding</i>,
<i>physicing</i>, <i>sweating</i>, <i>sparring</i>, <i>weighing</i>, <i>cutting out</i>,
(alias trimming,) and bringing his bag and cock to
the pit; where, upon delivering it to the <i>setter-to</i>,
his function ceases in respect to that particular cock,
till death has sealed his disgrace, or success proclaimed
his victory.</p>

</div>

<div class="pagenum">{134}</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>COCK-MATCH</h3><p>;—an agreement and article
entered into by opposite parties, to shew any number
of cocks (as "twenty-one, thirty-one, or forty-one)
on each side in the <i>main</i> and ten in the byes,
to fight for ten guineas a battle, and fifty the odd."
The cocks so agreed to be matched, are under the
management of their different feeders till the day
specified in the article for their being <i>shewn</i> and
<i>weighed</i>; which day is, upon most occasions, <i>the day
but one</i> preceding the day on which the main begins
to be fought. This ceremony is attended to with
the most scrupulous nicety on each side; every
cock is weighed precisely to a <i>quarter</i> of an <i>ounce</i>;
his colour described almost to a <i>feather</i>; his marks
in the eye, the <i>right</i> and <i>left norrel</i>, the <i>in right</i> and
<i>out left</i> in the feet, are all taken down in writing
with the same accuracy as the weight; the whole
being entered in the match-bills to be produced,
read, and compared, with the cocks as they are
brought to pit at the commencement of every
battle.</p>

</div>

<p>The number of cocks having been shewn and
weighed on each side, the match-bills containing their
weights are compared; and all those who are either
dead weights, or within an ounce of each other,
are said to <i>fall in</i>, and are called <i>main battles</i>; in
contra-distinction to those who do not come within
the ounce of each other, and are <i>thrown into</i> the
<i>byes</i>; which are generally fought for a trifling sum,
<span class="pagenum">{135}</span>
and have no affinity whatever to the <span class="smcap lowercase">MAIN</span>. Should
the cocks thus falling in constitute either a very
small or an <i>even</i> number, it is usual then to separate
cocks of <i>dead weights</i>, or the nearest so, to match
against others, (giving or taking an ounce in
weight,) that the main may be extended in respect
to the number of battles, and that number to be
<i>odd</i>; thereby preventing, if possible, the
<span class="smcap lowercase">MAINS</span> being
<i>undecided</i>; which, indeed, sometimes happens
unavoidably by the chance of <i>a drawn battle</i>.</p>

<p>That the match may be the better understood,
let it be supposed that A stands engaged with B
"to shew twenty-one cocks on each side, <i>ten</i> guineas
a battle, and <i>fifty</i> the <span class="smcap lowercase">MAIN</span> or <i>odd</i> battle." Of
these fifteen fall into the <i>main</i>; and the remaining
six are thrown into <i>byes</i>, and fight for two guineas a
battle. It is in such case a custom to fight a part
of the byes, both <i>before</i> and <i>after</i> such part of the
main as is fought on <i>each day</i>, whether it is finished
in one day, or is a long main of many days duration.
The match being concluded, we find A has
won <i>nine main</i> battles and <i>two byes</i>; B <i>six main</i>
battles and <i>four byes</i>; when the winning and losing
will stand precisely thus: A having three battles ahead
in the main, is a winner of fifteen guineas upon
the <i>single</i> battles; and winning the main also, he wins
the twenty-five guineas upon that event; making
himself the creditor for forty guineas: but in the
<i>byes</i>, B having the advantage of <i>four</i> battles to <i>two</i>
<span class="pagenum">{136}</span>
won by A, affords him a drawback of two guineas;
and B is the loser of thirty-eight guineas battle-money
upon the whole match; it being remembered,
the byes were fought for only two guineas
a battle; or, in other terms, a guinea <i>each cock</i>.
And this it will be necessary for young adventurers
to remember, that a match made for "ten guineas a
battle," is tantamount to five guineas <i>each</i> cock;
and "fifty guineas the odd of the main," is always
<i>bona fide</i> understood a deposit (if required)
before fighting of five-and-twenty guineas a-side.</p>

<p>Cocks of middling size, and adequate powers,
are always considered the sharpest and best fighters;
in confirmation of which opinion, custom has established
the match weights from three pounds six
ounces to four pounds eight; none to be shewn and
weighed in the main under the former, or above
the latter, unless an extension to either a <i>lower</i> or a
<i>higher</i> weight should be agreed on by the parties.
Sometimes (but very seldom) a short match, of a
different kind, takes place, and is termed a "<i>shag-bag</i>"
match, (or battle;) which is no more (the battle
money having been previously agreed on) than
"turning the cock out at the bag's mouth" in the
pit, to meet his opponent, without ever having been
brought to the scale, or the weight of his adversary
ascertained.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{137}</div>

<p>In weighing the cocks, and making the match-bill,
it is an invariable rule to begin with the <i>lightest</i>
pair, who are to fight <i>first</i>, and so continue according
to their weight <i>upwards</i>; such successive pair
being heavier than the former, so that the heaviest
pair of cocks is fought the last. Various sums being
betted upon a match (or main) soon after it is
made, it may not be inapplicable to observe, that
those who lay <i>the odds</i> in any proportion, as <i>five</i> to
<i>four</i>, <i>six</i> to <i>four</i>, <i>two</i> to <i>one</i>,
(or whatever odds may
be laid,) either upon the main or a <i>single</i> battle, is
always entitled to the privilege of <i>choosing his side</i>,
although it may not be mentioned; and this right
he is possessed of in consequence of <i>laying the
odds</i>.</p>

<h3>COCKPIT</h3><p>,—a place appropriated entirely to
the purpose of <span class="smcap lowercase">COCK-FIGHTING</span>, for which it is
erected; it is usually of an oblong or circular form,
surrounded with seats, to which the spectators pay
for admission; and in great mains, or subscription
matches, the <span class="smcap lowercase">FEEDERS</span>
generally agree with the masters
of the match to receive the whole of this <i>door
money</i>, (equally divided between them,) as their
compensation for the fortnight or three weeks they
are engaged in feeding the cocks.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>COCKPIT ROYAL</h3><p>.—The cockpit royal is
considered sanction sufficient for the diversion of
<span class="smcap lowercase">COCK-FIGHTING</span> in every part of the kingdom. It
<span class="pagenum">{138}</span>
is situate on the south side of St. James's Park,
from which it has its entrance, and was erected in
the reign of King Charles the Second, who, having
been himself fond of the sport, is said to have frequently
honoured it with his presence, when
matches were made and fought amongst his nobles. It
is the only place where <i>long mains</i>, and great
<span class="smcap lowercase">SUBSCRIPTION MATCHES</span>,
are fought in the Metropolis;
some of which are for considerable sums between
opulent individuals, who procure their cocks from
different parts of the country; and others (particularly
the subscription matches) by many members
on each side, who breed their cocks in distant counties,
but fight them only in town; of which description
many matches are annually fought during all
the spring months, when both <span class="smcap lowercase">STAGS</span>
and <span class="smcap lowercase">COCKS</span> are
in the finest feather and highest perfection.</p>

</div>

<p>The cockpit is circular, and completely surrounded
with seats six tier deep; exclusive of a rail,
with standing room all round the summit of the
uppermost seat; forming, in the whole, a perfect
amphitheatre. The centrical circle upon which the
<i>cocks fight</i> is a raised mound of earth, (surrounded
with boarding,) about twenty feet in diameter, and
should, according to the technical term of the <i>sport</i>,
be covered with a fine green turf, denominated <i>sod</i>;
in conformity with the general acceptation of the
word in the sporting world, where by "<i>the sod</i>" is
implied <span class="smcap lowercase">COCKING</span>.
By "the <i>turf</i>," <span class="smcap lowercase">RACING</span> is equally
<span class="pagenum">{139}</span>
understood. In all mains or matches fought in
the country parts of the kingdom, cocks invariably
fight upon the sod; but as it is an article difficult to
obtain in the Metropolis, and would be inconvenient
and inapplicable during <i>hard frosty</i> weather,
when many matches are fought, <i>matting</i> upon the
surface is substituted in its stead.</p>

<p>On each side the circular mound, at its extremity,
and exactly opposite to each other, are two small
seats for the <i>setters-to</i>; who retire to those seats during
long fighting, or when ordered by the betters
and spectators so to do. Directly over the centre
is suspended from the dome, by a chain, a very
large circular branch, containing a great number of
candles, affording a profusion of light; for nearly
all the matches fought here are very <i>unnaturally</i>
decided by <i>night</i>, the company going to pit at six
o'clock in the evening.</p>

<p>At the hour previously agreed on, <i>the bags</i> containing
the cocks are brought into the pit by the
<span class="smcap lowercase">FEEDERS</span>,
or who ever they may appoint: they are
there received by persons called the <i>setters-to</i>,
whose qualifications depend upon a <i>quick eye</i>, a
<i>light hand</i>, and <i>agile heel</i>; without the whole of
which, celebrity can never be acquired in their
way. The cocks being taken from the bags, are
most scrupulously compared in <i>feather</i> and <i>marks</i>
with the original description entered in the match-bill
<span class="pagenum">{140}</span>
on the day of weighing; if there should prove
the most trifling deviation from which, a mistake
<i>wilful</i> or accidental is supposed to have taken place,
and no progress whatever is made <i>in fighting</i>, till
it is completely rectified, and the cause done away.
This scrutiny is seriously critical, and made by
the <span class="smcap lowercase">FEEDERS</span>,
who attend minutely to the <i>match-bill</i>
and <i>marks</i> of each other's cocks; which ceremony
gone through, and admitted to be right, the feeders
retire from the centre of the pit, becoming spectators;
and the <i>setters-to</i> are then the sole possessors
with the cocks in hand. In this state they are
shewn to each other "<i>beak to beak</i>;" and if they
"show fight," they are (for form's sake in the first
battle only) given into the hands of the makers
(called masters) of the match, who are situate in the
lowest circular seat opposite to each other, and they
giving the cocks a <i>set-to</i> toss upon the mat, the
battle begins amidst clamours indescribable, and
offers of bets innumerable, according to the pecuniary
sensations, opinions and predictions of the
different parties interested in the event, constituting
a scene very far beyond the power of description,
and which must be seen to be perfectly understood.</p>

<p><i>Bettings</i> now take place of every kind, as well
upon the battle then fighting, as upon the main
(meaning the <i>odd</i> battle) of the first <i>three</i>, the first
<i>five</i>, &amp;c. Bets made upon the "<span class="smcap lowercase">LONG MAIN</span>,"
imply the winner of the match at its termination,
<span class="pagenum">{141}</span>
in contra-distinction to betting upon the main of
<i>three</i>, of <i>five</i>, or of <i>seven</i> battles, which are very
frequently made. Sometimes the cocks on one
side are rather greater favourites than on the other,
from an idea of their being better blood, better fed,
or in finer condition; in this case, there are offers
of, "a shilling,"—"eighteen-pence,"—and not
unfrequently even "half a crown for a guinea;"
the meaning of which is, the person so offering,
is willing to give you either of the sums mentioned,
to bet him a guinea upon the battle, he
taking his choice for <i>buying the bet</i>. The person
receiving the half-crown to bet a guinea, stands precisely
thus; if his cock is successful, he is the winner
of one pound, three shillings and sixpence;
on the contrary, he can be a loser of only eighteen
shillings and sixpence, having previously received
half a crown from his adversary toward the guinea
he has got to pay: a recollection of this advantage is
equally necessary in proportional betting of greater
magnitude, as sometimes half a guinea is offered
for five pounds, or a guinea for ten.</p>

<p>Persons taking these bets, whether for large or
small sums, should, if the odds in fighting come to
<i>two</i> or <i>three</i> to <i>one</i> in favor of the cock they have
backed, immediately take such odds, which is
called "hedging," (alluding to <i>a fence</i> for the bet,)
and the party then stands the chance of <i>winning</i> a
certain number of pounds to the losing of <i>nothing</i>!
<span class="pagenum">{142}</span>
This is the only mode by which money can be made
in a cockpit, and what the <i>professional amateurs</i> are
always prompted by prudence to do; as it is a very
common thing, during a battle, for the odds to
vary, till <i>three</i>, <i>four</i>, or <i>five</i> to <i>one</i> are betted upon
each cock: a person taking the five to one <i>each</i>
way, will consequently derive an advantage of <i>four</i>
guineas from <i>either</i> cock, let which ever will win.
There are never wanting persons in a pit who are
attached to the cocks on one side or the other;
these are always ready to offer bets of <i>ten</i>, <i>eleven</i>,
and <i>twelve</i> to <i>four</i>, that the opposite party "does not
win two battles running:" If the cocks on that side
are healthy, properly fed, and in equal condition,
with those in the other pens, these are not bad bets
to take. As for instance; A bets B twelve half
guineas to four, that Charles Walter (the <i>feeder</i>)
does not win <i>two battles running</i>; it happens he
wins the <i>first</i>, (which is no more or less than <i>even</i>
betting he does;) then B prudently backs the opposite
party for two guineas the <i>second</i> battle of the
two, and of course stands the winning of <i>four
guineas</i> to the losing of <i>nothing</i>.</p>

<p>In a cockpit, the faculties of every man, who
sports his money, must be feelingly alive, to escape
the most villainous depredations. <i>The family</i>,
who exist only by the most abandoned and unprincipled
scenes of infamy, are always prepared to <i>deny</i>
their bets <i>when they lose</i>, particularly with noviciates;
<span class="pagenum">{143}</span>
and with this advantage, they are always supported by
<i>gentlemen</i> of their own party on each side of them,
<i>ready to swear</i>, "he had <i>no bet</i> with you;" but
if he <i>wins</i>, he demands his money of you, and
receives it; consequently, in the difference of
receiving and <i>not paying</i>, he has <i>ten</i> to <i>one</i> the advantage
of a <span class="smcap lowercase">YOUNG ADVENTURER</span>, particularly as
you cannot call for "cover," in the ten thousand
clamours, and <i>Babel-like</i> building, of a cockpit. At
the termination of every battle, the betters leave
their seats to adjust, pay and receive the winnings
and losings dependent upon the battle just decided;
it being a regular point, that the <i>winner</i> makes application
to the better who has <i>lost</i>; and no disgrace
is annexed to the character of the latter by
his omitting to follow the former, it being sufficient
to pay the <i>bet</i> when <i>demanded</i>.</p>

<p>There are certain rules and laws of custom to be
observed in fighting; the most material of which
it is necessary to explain. When once the cocks
are pitted, neither of the <span class="smcap lowercase">SETTERS-TO</span> have the
privilege to touch or handle his cock, so long as
they continue to fight, unless their weapons hang in
the mat, they are entangled with each other, are
got too close to the edge of the pit, or have left off
fighting while the umpire or law-teller can count
<i>forty</i>; when, in either of those cases, each setter-to
instantly handles his cock, bringing them <i>beak to
beak</i> in the middle of the pit: if <i>one cock</i> has refused
<span class="pagenum">{144}</span>
to fight while the telling forty took place,
his adversary, who made the last fight, with either
<i>heel</i> or <i>beak</i>, is said to have the first law in his favour.
When brought beak to beak, and set on
their legs, if the cock who did not fight while the
<i>forty was telling</i>, continues to decline fighting, the
setter-to of his adversary (or umpire, if there is
one) proceeds to tell <i>ten</i>; which being done, they
are again handed, and brought <i>beak</i> to <i>beak</i>; if the
same cock continues still unwilling or unable to
fight, the ceremony of telling ten, and bringing
<i>beak</i> to <i>beak</i>, at the conclusion of every ten, takes
place, till it has been repeated <i>ten different times</i>,
when the cock so refusing to fight has lost his battle.
But should he fight during any part of the
law, (even in telling the last ten,) what has been
told is of no effect, and the first ten must be begun
again, whenever a fight is renewed. Instances
sometimes happen, when the cock who has the <i>long
law</i> in his favour, retreats from the cock seemingly
beaten, and in his turn has the law going on against
him; so that the cock who fights last has the law in
his favour, till one side or other is counted out.</p>

<p>If, during a battle, (either by long fighting or a
cut down blow,) any person offers to bet <i>ten pounds</i>
to a <i>crown</i>, or throws his <i>hat</i>, <i>glove</i>, or <i>handkerchief</i>,
into the pit, which is the same thing, and so understood,
though not a word is spoken, the teller immediately
begins to tell <i>forty</i> in a deliberate manner,
<span class="pagenum">{145}</span>
which being done, he proclaims, "ten pounds
to a crown is betted; will any body take it? will
any body take it?" No reply being made, the
battle is won by the cock upon whom the odds
were offered. On the contrary, should the bet be
accepted in words, or a handkerchief, <i>hat</i>, or <i>glove</i>,
be thrown into the pit, during the time of so telling
<i>the forty</i>, it is an acceptance of the <i>ten pounds</i> to a
<i>crown</i> offered, and the cocks are instantly handed
beak to beak in consequence. If a cock, having
the law in his favour, <i>dies</i> before the <i>long law</i> is <i>told
out</i>, his adversary wins the battle, although he did
not fight within the law; for there cannot be a
greater criterion of victory, than having killed his
opponent.</p>

<p>When the cocks are first shewn in the hands of
the setters-to, and either refuses <i>to face</i>, that is, to
fight, it is deemed <i>no battle</i>, upon the equitable
principle, that no man <i>can</i> lose where he has <i>no
chance</i> to win. There are frequently disputes between
the setters-to respecting which cock is in for
the law in his favour, during the changes which
sometimes happen by the various changes in setting-to
during the <i>long law</i>; as well as disputes amongst
the spectators concerning bets made, and misunderstandings
during the <i>heat of battle</i>; to prevent litigation,
and long-standing animosity, it is an invariable
rule, that all disputes are to be decided by a
majority of the pit; but in all pecuniary altercations,
<span class="pagenum">{146}</span>
both parties deposit their money before the
<i>question is asked</i>, in proof of their readiness to acquiesce
in the decision when made. Persons making
bets in a pit, which they were afterwards unable
or unwilling to pay, were formerly drawn up
in a basket by pullies, and suspended during <i>the
play</i>; that ceremony, however, is now nearly dispensed
with, the aggressor being instantly turned
out of the pit, with a variety of <i>cuffs</i> and <i>kicks</i>
plentifully bestowed upon him in the gauntlet of his
escape.</p>

<h3>COCK'S WALK</h3><p>—is the place to which a <i>game
chick</i> is removed, from the place where he was bred,
(and where he walked <i>under his sire</i>,) to the spot
where he is to remain till taken up to fight; this is
called <i>his walk</i>, of which he is the master, not walking
<i>under</i> any other cock. They are commonly
sent out to walk at six or seven months old, previous
to which they have their combs and gills taken
off, and are marked in the <i>eyes</i>, <i>norrils</i>, and <i>feet</i>.
At this age they are called <i>chickens</i>; when turned of

<h3>COFFIN-BONE</h3><p>.—This bone is situate at the
lower extremity of the foot, deposited in the membranous
mass with which the box (or <i>coffin</i>) of the
hoof is lined, and is in nearly the shape of the hoof
itself: in the centre of the coffin-bone is a concavity,
<span class="pagenum">{147}</span>
into which is inserted the <i>inferior</i> part of the <i>coronary
bone</i>, supported by the <i>nut bone</i> behind: upon
the superior part of the coronary bone (that is just
above the line said to be "<i>between hair and hoof</i>")
is lodged the lower part of the fetlock bone, its upper
part articulating with the fetlock joint. Injuries
are very frequently sustained by holes in the
road, or cavities in the pavement, into which a
part, or the whole, of the foot getting, ligamentary
twists or distortions happen to the lower joints.
Too much pains cannot be taken in accurately ascertaining
the exact seat of lameness, particularly
in these parts, as a great number of horses are annually
<i>blistered</i> and <i>fired</i> by much too hastily, and
upon parts where no lameness has ever been.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>COFFIN-JOINT</h3><p>,—the joint situate below the
fetlock, and just above the union of hair and hoof;
this is the part universally known by the term <i>coffin-joint</i>;
but, in fact, it is not in <i>reality</i> so; for this
being formed by the upper part of the coronet with
the lower part of the fetlock-bone, leaves the whole
coronary bone between the spot described and the
coffin-bone. The coffin-joint is buried in the body
of the hoof, and is formed by the convex junction
of the coronary bone with the concave part of the
coffin-bone, as explained in the article preceding.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>COLD</h3><p>.—A <span class="smcap lowercase">COLD</span> is evidently occasioned by some
sudden transition from heat to cold, a long exposure
<span class="pagenum">{148}</span>
to chilling rains, or a confined current of external
air, through some partial or particular channel: it
may be defined a <i>species</i> of <i>disease</i> derived from some
one peculiar cause, to which there may be many
probable points of termination, according to the
constitution, or pre-disposition of the subject at the
time of attack.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Cold</span> is much more likely to be acquired in a
horse by neglect or indiscretion, than by the effect
of chance: it is certainly prevented with more ease
than it can be cured; and those who ride or drive
their <i>own</i> horses, have this in constant recollection;
those who ride or drive the horses of <i>others</i>, have
seldom any such recollection at all. <span class="smcap">Horses</span> are
hardly ever known to get <i>colds</i> under the eye of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">MASTER</span>, but unluckily he cannot be employed in
the eternal superintendance of <i>a servant</i>, nor can
he carry the horse in his pocket. Colds unattended
to upon the first attack, not unfrequently degenerate
to something worse, displaying its progressive virulence
upon the eyes, the lungs, or in glandular tumefactions.
Colds (in general thought very little
of) cannot have their probable tendencies too soon
counteracted, particularly when it is remembered,
that if the blood is previously in a state of sizey
viscidity, an inflammation of the lungs may very
speedily follow, and carry off the patient in <i>two</i> or
<i>three</i> days, in opposition to every medical endeavour
that can be made to prevent it.
<span class="pagenum">{149}</span></p>

<p>A <span class="smcap lowercase">COUGH</span> is generally one of the first and most
distinguished symptoms of <i>cold</i>; for the collapsion
of the porous system having thrown the perspirative
matter upon the blood, its circulation through the
finer vessels of the lungs becomes proportionally
retarded, and constitutes the obstruction and consequent
irritation (or <i>tickling</i>) which almost incessantly
excites the cough; to relieve which, all writers
agree, that bleeding is the first step to be taken:
this to be followed by cordial balls, malt mashes,
thin gruel, &amp;c. &amp;c. the particulars of which may
be found fully explained in the "Gentleman's
Stable Directory," or "Compendium of Farriery,"
by the present Author.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>COLOUR</h3><p>.—Strange notions have formerly
prevailed, and much hypothetical writing and reasoning
have been equally produced, to collect sufficient
criterions to decide upon, for <i>a proof</i> that
the strength and constitutional stamen of the horse
depended as much or more upon his <i>colour</i> than his
formation. Sound judgment, and rational reflection,
would, however, induce a well-founded reason
to believe, there is more of fancy or <i>fallacy</i> in
such suggestion; and that the old maxim still stands
upon firm ground, "a <span class="smcap lowercase">GOOD</span>
horse can't be of a <i>bad</i> colour."</p>

</div>

<p>The bright and the dark <i>bay</i>, the jet <i>black</i>, the
<i>chesnuts</i>, the <i>browns</i>, and the <i>dappled greys</i>, are
<span class="pagenum">{150}</span>
each proportionally beautiful when in fine condition;
and are held preferable in pecuniary estimation
to the <i>sorrel</i>, the <i>dun</i>, the <i>roan</i>, the <i>flea-bitten</i>,
the <i>strawberry</i>, and the <i>nutmeg</i> or <i>iron-grey</i>. There
is a prevalent idea amongst people of a certain
class, that many of the latter description are very
much inferior in spirited exertion, less calculated
for hard work, not such good feeders under fatigue,
that they feel the effect of age sooner, that their
powers do not continue so long unimpaired, that
they are more susceptible of disease, and, lastly,
that they are shorter lived, than those called the
<i>hardy</i> colours, first mentioned. That there will always
be a variety of opinions in mere matter of
conjecture cannot be denied, any more than that
the framers and supporters of those opinions will
magnify <i>mole hills</i> to <i>mountains</i> in defence of their
own sagacity; notwithstanding which, it must be
admitted, that variety of inferences might be drawn
to justify a conclusion, that many of those observations
may have the basis of truth for their foundation,
if this was the place proper for such elucidation.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the colour of the horse, it
is a practice with old sportsmen, and good judges,
to reject <i>white heels</i>, and <i>white hoofs</i>, if they can
be avoided: experience has proved, beyond all
fear of contradiction, that white heels are more
<i>tender</i>, and white hoofs more subject to <i>defects</i>, and
susceptible of injury, in <i>thrushes</i>, <i>corns</i>, and <i>sand-cracks</i>,
<span class="pagenum">{151}</span>
than any other; and none more so, than
light chesnuts with blazes and white heels: the
hoofs are frequently shelly, brittle, narrow at the
heel, diseased in the frog, and contracted in the
feet. Prudence should prompt every man (in a
new purchase) to pay some respect to the <i>lower</i> as
well as the <i>upper</i> story; it being evidently more
advantageous to <i>reflect in time</i>, than to repent at
leisure.</p>

<h3>COLLEGE VETERINARY</h3><p>,—an equestrian
establishment for the improvement of farriery: it
is situate about a mile north-east of Tottenham-Court
Road, at Camden Town, in the parish of
St. Pancras, and will be explained more at large
under the head, <span class="smcap">Veterinary College</span>.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>COLT</h3><p>,—in the general sense, and immediate
acceptation of the term, implies a produce from
<span class="smcap">Horse</span> and <span class="smcap">Mare</span>,
without adverting for the moment
to either the <i>masculine</i> or the <i>feminine</i> gender;
but in a more contracted point of view, (as well
as in just and sporting-like phraseology,) it is meant
to convey an unequivocal idea, that the produce
being <span class="smcap lowercase">A COLT</span>, is really so,
that is a <i>horse colt</i>,) in
contra-distinction to the opposite gender, invariably
called <i>a filly</i>. The bone and growth of a colt depends
greatly upon two circumstances: the first,
his being foaled late or early; that is, <i>early</i> in
<i>April</i>, or <i>late</i> in <i>June</i>; as well as the difference of
<span class="pagenum">{152}</span>
his being weaned in November or March. Although
it is admitted that colts (in the first year termed
foals) running with the dam during the winter, will
afford greater probability of size, bone, and
strength, yet it is not at all times it can be complied
with, unless in studs, where <i>brood</i> mares are
kept for that purpose only, and are left fallow
(<i>uncovered</i>) for the season. When a mare has
been covered with a foal at her foot, and is evidently
in foal again, it should be an invariable rule to
wean the foal in October or November, upon the
palpable impossibility of giving suck to the one,
without an impoverishment of the other. Whether
the colt is, or is not, weaned in either of those
months, he should be well kept, and have daily
supplies of corn and hay, as well as proper <i>stable</i>,
<i>shed</i>, or <i>shelter</i> from the inclemency of the winter
season. Upon the liberal keep of the two first
winters, his size, growth, strength, and bone, entirely
depend, and must be particularly attended to,
lest repentance come too late; for it must be held
in remembrance, that if a colt is <i>small</i> at two
years old, from having been <i>stinted in keep</i>, there
is not one in a hundred ever attains to good size,
by any additional exertions or expence, after the
natural efforts for expansion have been so long retarded.</p>

</div>

<p>As <span class="smcap lowercase">COLTS</span> of any description (except for
<span class="smcap lowercase">THE TURF</span>) are seldom taken in hand,
at least offered for
<span class="pagenum">{153}</span>
sale, or brought into work, till they are <i>three years
old</i>, it is totally unnecessary to go into a minute
description of their <span class="smcap lowercase">AGE</span>
by the <span class="smcap lowercase">TEETH</span> previous to
that period. Suffice it, therefore, to observe, the
<i>twelve teeth</i> in the front of the mouth are, from
their original appearance, called <span class="smcap lowercase">COLT'S TEETH</span>, and
so continue to be, till dispossessed, and followed by
<i>others</i> which we proceed to describe: and that
a matter of such necessary information may (with
very little attention) be perfectly understood, an
accurately engraved <span class="smcap">Plate</span> is annexed, with such
explanatory matter, as will bring the subject home
to the plainest comprehension.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colts' teeth</span> are, in whiteness and appearance,
not inferior to polished ivory; are individually
smooth upon the surface, or seat of mastication,
and so continue till some time between <i>two</i> and a
<i>half</i> and <i>three years old</i>; when, a few weeks sooner
or later, (depending entirely upon their having
been <i>late</i> or <i>early</i> foals,) but within the space of
time specified, he sheds the two middle teeth of
the <span class="smcap lowercase">SIX</span> in the under jaw: these are pushed forward,
and succeeded by two of a stronger formation,
deeper in color, fluted, as it were, or having small
grooves from top to bottom, with a natural black
cavity in the centre, as represented in <i>figure the first</i>
of the <span class="smcap">Plate</span>, when the colt will be found rising
<span class="smcap lowercase">THREE YEARS OLD</span>.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{154}</div>

<p>Some time in the <i>last half</i> of the <i>fourth year</i>, the
same process takes place with the teeth on <i>each</i> side
the two in the centre, (already described to have
undergone the change;) so that at four years old
we find a repetition of (or addition to) the <i>first two</i>,
at which particular period he becomes possessed of
<span class="smcap lowercase">FOUR</span> horse teeth in the middle,
and <i>one</i> colt's tooth
only on each side, as will be observed in the <i>second
figure</i> of the <span class="smcap">Plate</span>, where is represented the mouth
of a colt when <span class="smcap lowercase">FOUR YEARS OLD</span> off, which he
should be properly called till the fall of the leaf;
after that time it is the custom to say, he is
<span class="smcap lowercase">RISING FIVE</span>.</p>

<p>At this time, that is, some time in the autumn,
as <i>September</i>, <i>October</i>, or <i>November</i>, (depending
a little upon his having been a late or early foal,)
he sheds the two remaining outside or corner teeth,
the successors to which continuing to push out till
the May or June following, when he is full in
the mouth, <span class="smcap lowercase">FIVE YEARS OLD</span>, and then called a
horse.</p>

<p>During the course of this year, the single teeth,
called <span class="smcap lowercase">TUSKS</span>, seated beyond the corner teeth upon
the bars, appear; and proper attention to the infantine
or advanced state of this projection, will
evidently demonstrate the <i>fifth</i> year of age; notwithstanding
any trifling variation, or singular exception,
to the law of Nature already laid down;
<span class="pagenum">{155}</span>
as may be accurately collected from an attentive
inspection of the <i>third figure</i> in the <span class="smcap">Plate</span>, where
the subject is to be considered <span class="smcap lowercase">FIVE YEARS OLD</span>,
off, and through the whole of the year is termed
"rising six;" the year not terminating till the <span class="smcap">first of May</span>,
from which every horse takes his age;
and it is customary to say he is coming six, or will
be <i>six years old</i> next grass.</p>

<p>In the space of the last six months of the <i>sixth</i>
year, the cavity of the two <i>middle</i> teeth of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">SIX</span>
(already described to have succeeded the two in the
<i>first</i> change at three years old) gradually fill up,
and when turned of <span class="smcap lowercase">SIX YEARS OLD</span>, retain a faint
remains of the original <i>black mark</i>, but is nearly or
quite smooth upon the surface.</p>

<p>In the <i>last half</i> of the <span class="smcap lowercase">SEVENTH YEAR</span>,
when the horse is termed "<i>six off</i>," (or rising seven,) the
teeth on each side the two centrical, last described,
become <i>gradationally</i> possessed of the same appearance;
and when <span class="smcap lowercase">SEVEN YEARS</span> are fully attained,
the two outside or corner teeth <i>only</i> bear <i>any mark</i>
of the original cavity. At this period the <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSE</span>
is said to be <i>aged</i>; and from this time to the completion
of his <i>eighth year</i>, the faint mark in the corner
teeth continues gradually to disappear (varying
a little in different subjects) till quite obliterated,
when the <span class="smcap lowercase">AGE</span> by the
<span class="smcap lowercase">TEETH</span> is no longer a matter to
be relied on, but becomes totally dependent upon
<span class="pagenum">{156}</span>
the <i>immaculate</i> declaration of the <span class="smcap lowercase">DEALER</span>,
or the <i>ipse dixit</i> of the <span class="smcap lowercase">BREEDER</span>,
if that can be <i>bona fide</i>
obtained. This description will be found accurately
delineated in the <i>fourth figure</i> of the <span class="smcap">Plate</span>.</p>

<p>As the curious, but very common, <i>operation</i> of
<span class="smcap">Bishoping</span> has been properly explained under
<i>that head</i>, so another <i>deception</i>, in full practice by
the fraternity of <i>horse-dealers</i>, must not be forgotten;
they consider it a <span class="smcap lowercase">LAW</span> of
<span class="smcap lowercase">PRIVILEGE</span>, and
never omit an opportunity of gratifying their professional
sensations. By referring to <i>figure the second</i>
of the <span class="smcap">Plate</span>, (where the teeth represent the
state of the mouth at <i>four years old off</i>,) may be
seen the four centrical teeth with the <i>black cavities</i>,
and the two <span class="smcap lowercase">COLT'S TEETH</span> at the corners, without
any mark at all. In this state they are frequently
purchased of the simple harmless <span class="smcap lowercase">BREEDER</span> in the
<i>country</i>; but they are very seldom a few hours in
the possession of a <span class="smcap lowercase">DEALER</span>, before
the <i>fertility</i> of
his imagination is at work to <i>rectify</i> the <i>deficiencies</i>,
and to anticipate the very intent and effort of
<span class="smcap">Nature</span>.</p>

<p>The two corner <span class="smcap lowercase">COLT'S TEETH</span> just described, are
immediately <i>wrenched</i> from their sockets, with even
a common <i>door key</i>, or the first iron instrument
that can be found applicable for the purpose; and
this is done as a substitute for the impending exfoliation,
by way of giving earlier opportunity for
<span class="pagenum">{157}</span>
the appearance and growth of their successors, that
the <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSE</span> may be shown out as, and affirmed to
be, a <span class="smcap lowercase">FIVE YEARS OLD</span>, when, in fact,
he is positively no more than four. This is an imposition
very little better than a <span class="smcap lowercase">ROBBERY</span>, and principally
practised upon the young and inexperienced, (the
<span class="smcap lowercase">DEALER'S</span> best <i>friends</i>,)
but seldom attempted to be
<i>played off</i> with the <span class="smcap lowercase">OLD SPORTSMAN</span>,
whose very <i>mode</i> of making his examination, speedily displays
a proof of his qualifications, and generally shields
him from any very palpable species of depredation.</p>

<p>When a <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSE</span> is considerably
advanced in <i>years</i>,
but still <i>full</i> in the <i>frame</i>, and <i>fresh</i> upon his <i>legs</i>,
it is a general rule, even with the best and most
experienced judges, to form an opinion tolerably
accurate by the <i>length</i> of his <span class="smcap lowercase">TEETH</span>;
but this can by no means be considered infallible; as some
horses carry a mouth <i>so much better</i> than others of
a less age, that it can constitute no certain criterion
of decision.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CONDITION</h3><p>—is a word in frequent use with
the sporting world, to express the state of a horse
in respect to his health and external appearance.
If low in flesh, rough in his coat, hollow above the
eye, and depressed in his spirits, he is then said to
be "very much out of <i>condition</i>." But, on the
contrary, if full of good sound flesh, his skin loose
<span class="pagenum">{158}</span>
and pliable, with his coat soft and sleek, he is then
said to be in "perfect condition to start," if for the
<span class="smcap lowercase">TURF</span>; fine condition to <i>take the field</i>,
if a <span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTER</span>;
or, if a roadster, to be in good condition to undertake
his journey. Horses too full of flesh or of
blood, are said not to be in <i>condition</i>, because they
are not fit for strong exertions without the danger
of disease: brought into constant work in such
state, they soon, as it is termed, "<i>fall all to pieces</i>;"
that is, if they escape inflammation upon some of
the various parts, morbidity soon displays itself,
either in a swelling of the legs, cracked heels, bad
eyes, defective wind, cutaneous eruptions, tumours,
or in one of the many ills to which horses in this
state will always be subject.</p>

</div>

<p>Experience has so fully confirmed this fact, and
custom has so firmly established the great prudence
of prevention, that much disgrace and mortification
is incurred by both <span class="smcap lowercase">MASTER</span>
and <i>groom</i>, who are so
unfortunate as to have horses <i>out of condition</i>; and
this is so perfectly understood in the present state
of equestrian emulation, that the necessity for occasionally
cleansing the frame by <span class="smcap lowercase">BLEEDING</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">PURGING</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">DIURETICS</span>, or a course of
<span class="smcap lowercase">ALTERATIVES</span>, is not only
almost universally acknowledged, but generally
practised by every judicious and well informed
<span class="smcap lowercase">SPORTSMAN</span> in the kingdom.
<span class="pagenum">{159}</span></p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CONSTIPATION</h3><p>—implies that state of the
bowels, when, for want of the necessary secretion
of mucus, their excrementitious contents acquire a
degree of solidity bordering upon induration; the
dung becomes too hard and adhesive, fœtid in
effluvia, and dark or nearly black in appearance.
A horse in such state should not be long neglected;
inflammatory cholic and consequent danger may
ensue; or an indurated mass may be formed in the
intestinal canal, which no medicine may have the
power to move in time to prevent mortification.
Too nice attention cannot be paid to a horse's regular
evacuations: if the body is evidently foul,
he should be proportionally physicked. Circumstances
not rendering that perfectly convenient,
opening mashes might be adopted, and continued
nightly (or oftner) till the constipation is removed.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CONSUMPTION</h3><p>.—A consumption is a disorder
to which horses are very much subject, particularly
the carriage horses of the great and opulent:
these fall victims to the unmerciful ambition
of <i>nocturnal</i> grandeur, in the four, five and six
hours street-waiting in the most dreary nights of the
most dreary winter. Consumptions originate in
<i>colds</i>, which being ill managed or neglected, constitute
an increasing viscidity of the blood; this preternatural
consistence renders it more languid in its
circulation; and it is, of course, proportionally impeded
in its progress through the finer vessels of the
<span class="pagenum">{160}</span>
lungs. Here then <i>obstructions</i> are first formed; as
these increase, the passages become impervious; the
<i>tubercles</i> continue to enlarge, till the vessels are
partially distended to their utmost extent, when inflammation
takes place, and maturation follows.
This stage completed, the tumours rupture; some
probably heal by the efforts of nature, and others
become <i>corroding ulcers</i>, laying the foundation of
inevitable danger, and distant death. To a penetrative
eye, and distinguishing hand, the predominant
symptoms will be immediately found to exceed
the traits and appearances of a common cold: the
unequal and difficult respiration; the kind of half-suppressed,
sore, hollow cough, (denoting an internal
sensation of pain,) terminating in a sort of resigned
moan; a constant desire to masticate hay,
without any seeming enjoyment of it; a general
heavy dulness, the palpable effect of conscious decay
or debility; and a frequent looking to and after
the person accustomed to superintend him, exciting
reason to believe he may expect or hope for relief
from the very hand from whence it has been usual
to derive support.</p>

</div>

<p>When brought into motion, the flanks heave,
and the cough comes on in proportion to the increase
of action and circulation: the pain thus produced
soon excites profuse perspiration: by the
efforts of snorting, sneezing, and blowing, to relieve
himself from the load under which he labours,
<span class="pagenum">{161}</span>
the discharge from the nostrils is increased, and
gets deeper in colour, according to the duration
and inveteracy of disease. Different subjects are
very differently affected by the gradations of this
disorder, (to which but a faint expectation of relief
can be at all formed;) as one horse will continue to
appear constantly declining, and to waste away perceptibly,
every symptom becoming more predominant
and distressing, till the scene is <i>finally closed</i>;
while another shall alter but very little in flesh,
coat, or external appearance, till within a few days
of his <i>falling dead</i> in his stall.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CONVULSIONS</h3><p>—are a spasmodic affection of
the muscular parts of the body, occasioned by extreme
pain acting upon the irritability of the nervous
system; and generally proceed from cholic,
inflammation of the kidnies, strangury, worms
preying upon the internal coat of the stomach, a
fullness of the vessels, and too great a flux of blood
to the brain; as well as a variety of causes, many
of which are, perhaps, very far beyond the utmost
extent of human investigation. Whenever they
come on, the scene becomes truly distressing; they
may be considered almost invariably certain indications
of approaching dissolution, instances being
exceedingly rare of a horse's recovery.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>COMPRESSION</h3><p>—is a term meant to convey
the idea of an injury sustained in the foot of a
<span class="pagenum">{162}</span>
horse from a contraction of the hoof, more particularly
at the heel, by indiscreet management in the
mode of <i>shoeing</i>: first, in forming the shoes too
narrow, and giving them an improper internal
curve at each heel; the injudiciously cutting away
the bars of the foot, (formed by nature for its proper
expansion;) the rasping away each side of the
heel, to make the <i>foot fit the shoe</i>, already put on
too small; all which is still more aggravated, by
the equally <i>infernal</i> and equally <i>invincible</i> practice
of <i>fitting</i> the shoe <i>red-hot</i> to the foot, in opposition
to every argument and entreaty, thereby drying up
and consuming the natural moisture of the internal
or fleshy sole, at the moment of cauterizing and
contracting the surface.</p>

</div>

<p>A hoof in the state described, holds forth, in its
appearance, ample proof of <i>compression</i> upon the
parts constituting the internal structure of the foot;
the membranous mass, the nut and coffin-bone,
thus pressed upon by the surrounding stricture, occasions
a torpidity, and consequent defect in action,
by no means dissimilar to the hobbling gait of an infant
in pain from the tightness and rigidity of new
leather shoes. Horses whose feet are thus destructively
reduced, are generally those to whom neither
<span class="smcap lowercase">MASTER</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">MAN</span> ever condescends to look: if proper
injunctions were laid upon the shoeing smith,
at each time of performing the operation, such a
scene of devastation could never ensue. When
<span class="pagenum">{163}</span>
the feet, by such mismanagement, have got into this
state, every possible application should be made to
promote growth and expansion. If the horse stands
constantly in the stable, fresh stopping of moist cow-dung
every night, with a plentiful impregnation of
spermacæti oil, all round the hoof, every night and
morning, are the most expeditious remedies for
the defect; but if it can be adopted with convenience,
<i>turning out</i> two or three months upon a moist
marshy piece of land will prove superior to every
other consideration.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>COOLERS</h3><p>—are such medicines as, by their
attenuating property, tend to divest the blood of its
viscidity, and to counteract threatened inflammation.
They are always useful in plethoric appearances:
when a horse is evidently overloaded, and above
himself in flesh, when the legs are full, round, and
all the vessels are palpably distended, cooling
medicines, and gentle exercise, are the direct means
of obtaining relief. <span class="smcap">Bleeding</span> should take the lead,
followed by a course of diuretics, <i>mild</i> or <i>strong</i>,
according to the size and strength of the subject.
Nitre, incorporated with half its weight of gum
Arabic in powder, and dissolved in the water, is
an excellent article of this description.</p>

<h3>CORNS</h3><p>,—as they are called, would be much
more properly denominated <i>bruises</i>, and are of infinite
trouble to those who implicitly submit to the
<span class="pagenum">{164}</span>
Quixotic schemes and manual dexterity of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">SMITH</span>; who, with a <i>secundum artem</i> expedition,
instantly renders the remedy worse than the disease.
As his principal province is the art of <i>cutting</i>,
he has no sooner the <i>drawing-knife</i> in his hand,
than he is at "<i>the bottom</i>:" his great object is the
destruction of parts; and he piques himself upon
doing more mischief in two minutes, than <span class="smcap">Nature</span>
can restore in three months. Impressed with no
idea but instrumental extirpation, he proceeds to
excavate the sole of the foot, till, having reached
the membrane, a protrusion ensues, and leaves him
a happy opening for the bar-shoe, hot-stopping, a
daily dressing, and the collateral considerations
which constitute a <i>sum total</i> by no means necessary.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Corns</span> mostly originate in the shoe having swerved
a little from its proper seat upon the wall or
crust of the hoof, and becoming, as it were, indented
upon the outer sole, occasions <i>a bruise</i>, appearing
to have ramifications of extravasated fluid
in very fine and oblique directions: the shoe being
permitted to press upon this part, (become irritable
by the injury it has sustained,) produces pain and
impediment to action. Upon the discovery that
such has taken place, the remedy is as simple as the
cause by which it was occasioned. The shoe being
carefully removed, take from the surface of what
is <i>miscalled a corn</i>, just enough to leave the part
free from pressure by the shoe; moisten once externally
<span class="pagenum">{165}</span>
with a few drops of oil of vitriol, or simple
aqua fortis; and the operative smith, farrier, or
veterinary surgeon, will not find a plea for the devastation
he is generally so ready to promote.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CORDIALS</h3><p>,—medically considered, are the
very reverse, in their property, of what has been
said under the subject of "<i>coolers</i>:" they are warm
aromatic articles, which stimulate to action the internal
coat of the stomach, enliven the circulation,
invigorate the frame, expel wind, strengthen the
digestive powers; and are, perhaps, without exception,
the best and most useful discovery yet made
for the prevention and cure of colds in horses, as
well as of some other disorders arising from an impoverished
state of the blood. Horses subject to
incessant fatigue in all weathers, particularly in the
wet and dirty months of winter, should never be
without the occasional interposition of a warm malt
mash, or a <span class="smcap lowercase">CORDIAL BALL</span>, after long journies or
severe chases, whenever circumstances may render
either or both necessary; the first being given at
night, the latter in the morning. After a previous
bleeding, these means may be considered infallible
in a cold and cough, and never known to fail, if
properly persevered in and attended to. The cordial
balls are also exceedingly useful, where a horse
is off his appetite, either from being overworked,
or from the very common and very injudicious
custom with weak servants, or penurious masters,
<span class="pagenum">{166}</span>
of administering large quantities of <i>nitre</i>, (as a
<i>cheap</i> and <i>efficacious</i> medicine,) till the blood is attenuated
and impoverished below the standard of
health, the solids reduced to a state of flaccidity,
the stomach nauseated, and the digestive powers
proportionally impaired.</p>

<h3>CORIANDER</h3><p>,—the name of <span class="smcap lowercase">A HORSE</span> who
acquired much celebrity by his performances upon
the <span class="smcap lowercase">TURF</span> for six years in succession. He was bred
by <span class="smcap">Mr Dawson</span>, and was got by Pot8oo's out of
<i>Lavender</i>, who was got by <i>Herod</i>; her dam by
<i>Snap</i>, out of <i>Sweet William's</i> dam by <i>Cade</i>. He
was foaled in 1786. In 1789, when three years
old, he beat <i>Jericho</i>, from the ditch-in, for 200
guineas, and <span class="smcap">Sir W. Aston's</span> <i>Marcia</i>, two year
old course, 100 guineas. First Spring meeting, 1790,
he beat <i>Buzzard</i>, seven stone each, 100 guineas.
Second spring meeting he beat him again for the
same sum. He beat <i>Egbert</i> and <i>Isabel</i>, a sweepstakes
of 100 guineas each; and <i>Shovel</i>, <i>Glaucus</i>,
<i>Alexander</i>, and <i>Sir Thomas</i>, a sweepstakes of 50
guineas each; <i>Baronet</i>, <i>Nimble</i>, <i>Egbert</i>, and <i>Sir
Pepper</i>, paying forfeit. He walked over for the
King's hundred at Ipswich; and beat <span class="smcap">Lord Barrymore's</span>
<i>Pellegrine</i> the two middle miles of the
Beacon for 200 guineas.</p>

</div>

<p>In 1791 he won a subscription purse, beating
<i>Spear</i>, <i>Isabel</i>, <i>Ruffian</i>, <i>Black Deuce</i>, and <i>Mouse</i>.
<span class="pagenum">{167}</span>
He also won the plate at <span class="smcap">Swaffham</span>, beating <i>Isabel</i>
and the <i>Sister to Imperator</i>; and the next day won
the other plate, beating <i>Clayhall</i>. At Newmarket,
in October, he beat <i>Highlander</i>, <i>Serpent</i>, <i>Halkin</i>,
and <i>Espersykes</i>; after which, from the ditch-in,
he beat <i>Escape</i>, <i>Skylark</i>, and <i>Pipator</i>.</p>

<p>When rising six years old, he received forfeit
from <span class="smcap">Sir C. Turner's</span> <i>Weathercock</i>, and won the
King's plate at <span class="smcap">Guildford</span>, beating <i>Enchanter</i> and
<i>Braggadocio</i>; also the King's plate at <span class="smcap">Nottingham</span>,
beating <i>Young Cicero</i>.</p>

<p>In 1793 he won the aged plate at <span class="smcap">Newmarket</span>,
beating <i>Dragon</i>, <i>Halbert</i>, and <i>Halkin</i>. He won
the King's plate also, beating the <span class="smcap">Duke of Bedford's</span>
<i>Skyscraper</i>. Second spring meeting, he
won the Jocky Club plate, beating <i>Skyscraper</i>,
<i>Bustler</i>, <i>Cardock</i>, and <i>Pipator</i>; and on the same day
won the weight for the aged plate, beating <i>Huby</i>,
<i>Volanté</i>, and <i>Eager</i>. In the same meeting he beat
<i>Buzzard</i> the Beacon Course for 200 guineas.</p>

<p>In 1794, when aged, he won <span class="smcap lowercase">THE WHIP</span> and
200 guineas, beating <i>Creeper</i>, ten stone each, over
the Beacon. He won 50l. at <span class="smcap">Chelmsford</span>, beating
<i>Sweeper</i>, and <i>Portland</i>; likewise 50l. at
<span class="smcap">Northampton</span>, beating <i>Triumvirate</i>, and a son of
<i>Faggergill</i>. At <span class="smcap">Newmarket</span>, in October, he won
the aged plate, beating <i>Quetlavaca</i>, <i>Exciseman</i>, and
<span class="pagenum">{168}</span>
<i>Halkin</i>; and in the same week he beat <span class="smcap">Lord Egremont's</span>
<i>Gohanna</i> (giving him 24lb.) and <span class="smcap">Lord Strathmore's</span>
<i>Hermes</i>. In the second October
meeting, being the last time of his running, he
won a subscription purse, (paying 50 guineas entrance,)
beating <span class="smcap">Lord Grosvenor's</span> <i>Exciseman</i>,
and <span class="smcap">Lord Sackville's</span> <i>Silver</i>. This extraordinary
horse was one of the very few who stood so
many years training, and so much severe running,
without an accident. He covered afterwards in
the north, at seven guineas, and has produced
some good runners.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CORNER TEETH</h3><p>—are the four teeth at the
extremities of each row in both the upper and the
lower jaw, situate between the middle teeth and the
tushes: the corner teeth in the lower jaw, are those
which the horse sheds when four years old off, and
rising five: these not spontaneously exfoliating in
time to accommodate the pecuniary propensity of
<i>the dealer</i>, he possesses the means and the practice of
selling a <i>four</i> year old colt for a
<span class="smcap lowercase">FIVE</span> year old
horse; and this is so constant, that there is <i>with that

<h3>CORONET</h3><p>—is the part surrounding the foot
of the horse just above the junction of hair and
hoof: the bone from which the name is derived,
bears great affinity in form to a ducal coronet, and
is situate between the lower part of the fetlock-bone
<span class="pagenum">{169}</span>
and the coffin, into which it is inserted, jointly
supported by the nut-bone behind. Ligamentary
twists, or distortions, sustained at the superior
junction of the coronary bone, frequently occasion
a prominence upon the <i>coronet</i>, which becoming

<h3><span class="smcap">COURSE of Medicine</span></h3><p>,—so called where

continuance, (producing symptoms of disquietude
more than of danger,) and are thus called to distinguish
them from those which, proceeding rapidly,
terminate sooner, and with more alarm. <span class="smcap">Cholic</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">STRANGURY</span>,

<h3>COURSING</h3><p>—is a species of sport that a celebrated
writer has traced to great antiquity; "it
having been treated on by <span class="smcap">Arrian</span>, who flourished
A. D. 150." The same author, the <span class="smcap">Rev. Mr. Daniel</span>,
in his elegant and truly entertaining publication
upon "<i>Rural Sports</i>," says,</p>

</div>

<p>"In our country, during the reign of <span class="smcap">King John</span>,
greyhounds were frequently received by him
as payment in lieu of money, for the renewal of
<i>grants</i>, <i>fines</i>, and <i>forfeitures</i>, belonging to the
Crown. The following extracts prove this Monarch
to have been exceedingly partial to this kind of
dogs. A fine paid A. D. 1203, mentions five hundred
marks, ten horses, and ten leashes of <i>greyhounds</i>.
Another, in 1210, one swift running
horse, and six <i>greyhounds</i>."</p>

<p>"In the days of <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>, when she was not
disposed herself to hunt, she was so stationed as to
see the coursing of <i>deer</i> with greyhounds. At
Cowdrey, in Sussex, the seat of Lord Montecute,
(now Lady Montague's,) A. D. 1591, one day
after dinner, the Queen saw from a turret sixteen
bucks, all having fair law, pulled down with greyhounds
in a lawn before the house."</p>

<p>Coursing was formerly extended to the <span class="smcap lowercase">DEER</span>, the
<span class="smcap lowercase">FOX</span>, and the
<span class="smcap lowercase">HARE</span>; and much ceremony was observed
in <i>park</i> and <i>paddock</i> coursing with the <i>former</i>,
<span class="pagenum">{171}</span>
even in the Royal presence. It is, however, now
principally confined to the hare, (except in the
season for <i>fawn</i> killing;) is not only universal in
most counties, but particularly patronized and promoted
in others. <span class="smcap">Clubs</span> are composed of the most
opulent and respectable members for the enjoyment
of the sport, who have mostly two (some three)
meetings in each season; the first established and
principal of which is the "Swaffham Coursing Society,"
instituted in Norfolk by the late <span class="smcap">Earl</span> of
<span class="smcap">Orford</span> in the year 1776, which is supported with
true personal spirit and sporting energy; the Bradwell
and Tillingham meetings, in Essex; the Flixton
Wolds, in Yorkshire; and the Ashdown Park meeting,
at Lambourn, in Berkshire.</p>

<p>The meetings at Swaffham are held on the second
Monday in November, and the first Monday
in February, unless prevented by frost or snow, in
which case they are then held the first open Monday
in or after November, and the first open Monday
in February; and not later. The Ashdown Park
meeting to be held at the Red Lion at Lambourn,
annually, the second Monday in November.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap lowercase">LAWS</span> of
<span class="smcap lowercase">COURSING</span> were arranged in the
reign of <span class="smcap">Queen Elizabeth</span> by the Duke of Norfolk,
and were sanctioned by the acquiescence of
the nobility, gentry, and sporting world, who then
followed the diversion; and have since been considered
<span class="pagenum">{172}</span>
the fixed criterion for the decision of all
bets, by which they are regulated and determined
to the present day. The person appointed to let
loose the greyhounds, was to receive into his slips
(or thongs) those matched to run against each other
so soon as he came into the field; and then to follow
next the hare-finder, or him who was to start the
hare, until he came to <i>the form</i>; and no horse or
foot men were to go before, or on either side, but
directly behind, for the space of about forty yards.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h4><span class="smcap">Rules.</span></h4><p>—A hare never to be coursed by more
than <span class="smcap lowercase">A BRACE</span> of <i>greyhounds</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>The hare-finder to give the hare three <i>soho's!</i>
before he put her from <i>her form</i>; to give notice to
the dogs, that they may attend to <i>starting</i>.</p>

<p>The hare to have <i>twelve score yards law</i> before
the dogs were loosed, unless the small distance from
cover would not admit it without danger of immediately
losing her.</p>

<p>The dog who gave the <i>first turn</i>, if there was
neither <i>cote</i>, <i>slip</i>, nor <i>wrench</i>, during the course,
<span class="smcap lowercase">WON</span>.</p>

<p>A <i>cote</i> is when a greyhound goes endways by his
fellow, and gives the hare <i>a turn</i>.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{173}</div>

<p><i>A cote</i> serves for <i>two turns</i>, and two <i>trippings</i> or
<i>jerkins</i> for <i>a cote</i>: if the hare did not turn quite
about, she only <i>wrenched</i>, and two <i>wrenches</i> stand
for a <i>turn</i>.</p>

<p>If there were no cotes given between a brace of
greyhounds, but that one of them served the other
at <i>turning</i>, then he that gave the hare <i>most turns</i>,
<i>won</i>; and if one gave as many turns as the other,
<i>then</i> he that <i>bore</i> the hare, won.</p>

<p>If one dog gave the <i>first turn</i>, and the other bore
the hare, he that bore the hare, won.</p>

<p>A <i>go-by</i>, or <i>bearing</i> the hare, was equivalent to
<i>two turns</i>.</p>

<p>If neither dog <i>turned</i> the hare, he that led last to
the covert, won.</p>

<p>If one dog turned the hare, served himself, and
turned her again, it was as much as a <i>cote</i>; for a
cote was esteemed <i>two turns</i>.</p>

<p>If all the course was equal, the dog that bore the
hare, won; if the hare was not borne, the course
was adjudged dead.</p>

<p>If a dog fell in a course, and yet performed his
part, he might challenge the advantage of a <i>turn</i>
more than he gave.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{174}</div>

<p>If a dog turned the hare, served himself, and
gave divers cotes, and yet in the end stood still in
the field, the other dog, if he <i>ran home to the cover</i>,
although he gave no turn, was adjudged the winner.</p>

<p>If by accident a dog was rode over in his course,
the course was void; and he that did the mischief
was to make reparation for the damage.</p>

<p>If a dog gave the first and last <i>turn</i>, and there
was no other advantage between them, he that gave
the <i>odd</i> turn, won.</p>

<p>He that came in first at the death, took up the
hare, saved her from being torn, cherished the dogs,
and cleansed their mouths from the fleak, was adjudged
to have the hare for his trouble.</p>

<p>Those who were appointed judges of the course,
were to give their decision before they departed
from the field.</p>

<p>Exclusive of the county clubs and local societies
established for the annual enjoyment of the diversion
upon a larger scale, <span class="smcap lowercase">COURSING</span> has its devotees,
who are as energetic in its defence, as its most enraptured
advocate can possibly be, for what he calls
the inexpressible pleasures of the chase: taken, however,
in a more extensive point of view, it is held
in nearly an equal estimation with <i>angling</i>, when
<span class="pagenum">{175}</span>
put in competition with the more attracting sports
of the field; and seems much better calculated for the
amusement of a <i>cynical solitary</i> disciplinarian, than
a mind open to all the more noble and exhilarating
sensations of the <span class="smcap lowercase">CHASE</span>.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>COSTIVENESS</h3><p>—will be sound satisfactorily
explained under the head <span class="smcap">Constipation</span>; to prevent
which, regular exercise, great friction, flank
rubbing, and frequent changes of food, will greatly
contribute.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CRACKS</h3><p>—in the heels of horses, during the
winter season, are found only in stables where the
master seldom or ever condescends to appear.
These trifles are too frequently attributed to a defect
in the <i>constitution</i> of the <i>horse</i>, when, with more
propriety, they might be fixed upon a <i>want</i> of <i>constitutional</i>
punctuality in the <i>groom</i>. Horses left
with <i>wet legs</i> and <i>heels</i> after chase or journey, particularly
in sharp easterly winds, or in frost and
snow, constitute the evil to a certainty. So severe
a rigidity is occasioned in the texture of the integument,
that it becomes partially ruptured, (or broken
in various places,) upon being brought into
action the following day: this, with the irritation
and friction occasioned by the sharp particles of
gravel and extraneous matter in the dirty roads,
soon produce enlarged lacerations of the most painful
description. The prudent part of the world
<span class="pagenum">{176}</span>
will always consider, as well in this, as in every
other case, that <i>prevention</i> is better than <i>cure</i>: servants
should be allowed in the stables, linen cloths
for rubbers to the heels, that they may never be left
in the least wet, particularly in the winter season,
when once getting <i>tender</i>, the stubbed ends of the
new and stiff straw frequently occasion or increase
such lacerations.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CRAMP</h3><p>—is a most extraordinary spasmodic
muscular contraction of some particular limb,
where the stiffness and rigidity of the part exceeds
belief. To those who have never been accustomed
to such cases, they are serious and alarming; for the
strength of two men is inadequate to the task of
rendering the affected limb pliable and active. The
cause is sometimes not to be ascertained; but it has
frequently arisen from a horse, in a high state of
perspiration, having been placed in a current of
<i>cold</i> air, or a <i>damp</i> stable, and in a few minutes
found not able to move. Standing still two or
three days in succession without exercise, after long
and constant travelling, is likewise known to produce
it. But whatever cause it may have originated
in, the direct road to relief is still the same.
Instantaneous <span class="smcap lowercase">BLEEDING</span>,
hot fomentation with a
decoction of aromatic herbs, immediately followed
up by strong friction with an old stable horse-brush,
and this by an embrocation of camphorated spirits,
half a pint, incorporated with one ounce of oil of
<span class="pagenum">{177}</span>
origanum, and a part of it patiently rubbed in upon
the particular part affected, never fails to relieve in
a <i>short time</i>. Should it, however, not take effect
so soon as expected, dissolve a <i>cordial-ball</i> in a
pint of gruel, to which add an ounce of <i>liquid
laudanum</i>, and let either or all the operations be
repeated in a few hours, should the case (or a relapse)
require it.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CREST-FALLEN</h3><p>.—A horse is said to be
crest-fallen, when the part running from the withers
to the ears, and upon which the mane grows,
is impoverished, and wasted, from the natural prominence
of its beautiful curve, to a state of reverse
hollowness or indentation. This is generally accompanied
by a total emaciation, brought on by
very <i>bad support</i>, or neglect under different degrees
of disease. The firmness and corresponding curve
of the crest is almost invariably a tolerable criterion
of the <i>health</i> and <i>condition</i> of the horse; and a judicious
inspector seldom omits this part of the examination.
If the flesh upon the crest is <i>firm</i>,
<i>solid</i>, and not flabbily soft, or fluctuating, it is a
good sign of constitutional strength; but a horse
having a low, bare, indented crest, will always
have a poor, weak, and impoverished appearance,
doing his owner no credit. This defect, however,
proceeds more from penurious keep, and temporary
starvation, than any cause or defect in Nature, and
<span class="pagenum">{178}</span>
may always be expeditiously remedied by liberal
support, and nutritious invigoration.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CRIB-BITING</h3><p>—is a habit acquired by some
horses, of incessantly biting the manger, and gulping
the wind; which appears, from observation, to
be more prejudicial to character, than to bodily
exertion. It is said, "young horses are most subject
to it; and that it is often occasioned by uneasiness
in breeding of teeth, and from being ill fed
when they are hungry. The bad consequences are
wearing away their teeth, spilling their corn, and
sucking the air in such quantities, as will often give
them the cholic or gripes."</p>

</div>

<p>It is certain a <i>crib-biter</i> never appears high in
flesh, or so full in condition as horses that are not
so; and so prejudicial is it considered by many,
that they will not admit a horse to be <i>perfectly sound</i>
if sold with this infirmity. Opinions vary upon
the <i>difference</i> it makes respecting the labor and fatigue
a horse of this description can undergo; some
asserting that "the defect keeps him <i>weak</i>, <i>languid</i>,
and unable to endure much work:" while others
as strenuously insist upon its being in no way
whatever prejudicial.</p>

  <p class="indent2">"Who shall decide when doctors disagree?"</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CROPPING</h3><p>—is the operation of taking off
the ears, which was till very lately performed with
<span class="pagenum">{179}</span>
a knife and wooden mould, rendering it both tedious
and painful: it is, however, now very much improved
by the invention of an instrument admirably
adapted to the purpose, by which the separation
of the ear is almost instantaneous. It is only adopted
where horses are <i>lop-eared</i>, and bear the appearance
of mules about the head. As the operation is at
best but a cruel mutilation, every humane and
tender mind will think it "more honored in the
breach than the observance."</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CROWN-SCAB</h3><p>—is a partial appearance about
the coronet of a horse, varying in different subjects,
according to the state of the object diseased.
It partakes a little of the disorder called <i>grease</i>, to
which, if unattended to, it would soon degenerate;
being a species of that defect, but in an inferior
degree. In some it appears as a scurfy eruption,
raising the hair, and turning it different ways, from
whence soon oozes a kind of oily ichor, fœtid in
smell, and greasy in appearance: in others, the
discharge is <i>thinner</i>, and more <i>watery</i>, according
to the greater or less degree of morbidity in the
frame, or acrimony in the blood. It has been a
practice with the old school to counteract its effects
by vitriolic lotions, slight styptics, and strong repellents:
scientific disquisition will not, however,
justify such treatment, but recommend daily mollification
with warm oatmeal gruel and a soft sponge;
when which is wiped gently dry with a soft linen
<span class="pagenum">{180}</span>
cloth, it may be very mildly impregnated with
camphorated spermacæti ointment, and the cure
assisted by mercurial physic, diuretic balls, or a
course of antimonial alterative powders.</p>

<h3>CUB</h3><p>.—A young fox is so called during the
<i>first</i> year.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CURB</h3><p>—is a callous enlargement, approaching
ossification, and is situate at the lower junction
of the bones, at the hind part of the hock, originally
attended with stiffness, and lastly with lameness
and pain. Curbs are evidently produced by <i>kicks</i>,
<i>blows</i>, sudden <i>turns</i> or <i>twists</i>, riding too hard (or
drawing too much weight) up hill: they should be
attended to on their first appearance, when they
soon submit to the usual modes adopted for extirpation.
Mild blistering frequently succeeds, particularly
where the operation is <i>twice</i> performed;
but when the case is of long standing, a few slight
feather strokes with the firing-iron may be necessary
to confirm the cure.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CURB</h3><p>.—The chain is so called, which is the
part of the bridle-bit fixed to one cheek, and passing
under the lower-jaw (and above the beard or
chin) to the other. By the rein being fixed to
rings or loops, at the lower extremity of the bit,
this chain, called curb, constitutes a fulcrum; and
the harder such rein is pulled, the harder will be
<span class="pagenum">{181}</span>
the pressure of the curb upon the under jaw, and
of course the greater power given to the rider.
The curb consists merely of a neat wrought chain,
small rings and links, by which it is fixed to the
cheek-eyes of the bit, and easily taken off and on
for the purpose of cleaning.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CURRY-COMB</h3><p>,—a well known stable utensil, in
constant use for the cleaning of horses. They are
much more applicable to <i>post</i> and <i>draft</i> horses, than
to horses of superior description, the fineness of whose
coats, and the tenderness of whose skins, occasion
much uneasiness to them during the <i>prickly persecution</i>,
and to whom good, sweet, clean straw-bands
are greatly preferable; it being matter of fair doubt,
whether more horses are not lamed in the stable
under the <i>dancing</i> ceremony of the curry-comb,
than by accidents upon the road, or strong exertions
in the field.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>CRUPPER</h3><p>,—a leathern convenience, or long
strap, annexed to the hinder part of the saddle,
having at the other extremity a loop to pass under
the tail; by which the saddle is prevented from getting
forward, and bringing the rider upon the neck
of the horse. Such aid is by no means required
with horses well made, and uniformly proportioned:
they are rarely brought into use, but where a horse
is <i>lower before</i> than <i>behind</i>; and are in so much
disrepute with amateurs and connoisseurs, that a
<span class="pagenum">{182}</span>
real sportsman would sooner part from his horse
than to <i>be seen ride</i> with <i>a crupper</i>.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3><span class="smcap">CUTTING in Action</span></h3><p>,—in the manege called
<i>interfering</i>, is lacerating the round inside projecting
part of the fetlock-joint, with the edge of the shoe,
upon the foot of the opposite leg. This arises
much more frequently from the indifference or
neglect in the owner, than from any imperfection
or defect of the horse; more horses <i>cut</i> from being
broke and put into work too young, rode too
long journies in a day, or over-worked when weary,
than from any cause whatever. Some horses, it is
true, <i>cut</i> from their formation, particularly those
narrow in the chest. Carriage horses, too, very
frequently cut <i>behind</i>; but this must in a great measure
be occasioned by the projecting parts and cavities
in the pavement, for all which the surest
footed horse existing cannot be prepared.

in two gallons of water, for a quarter of an hour,
<span class="pagenum">{184}</span>

<div class="combine">

<h3>DECOY</h3><p>,—a canal, river, pond, or sheet
of water, appropriated to the profitable purpose
of taking <i>wild ducks</i> and <i>teal</i>: it is a business
peculiar to those only who profess it, and conducted
upon a principle of the strictest stillness
and regularity. The person having the management
of a decoy, must possess taciturnity and patience
in a very great degree, both being brought into
constant practice; without which, success can neither
be expected or deserved. The fowl are brought
within the tunnel of the net by <i>stratagem</i>, where,
at a critical moment, they are enclosed and taken.
All this, however, depends upon the industry, sagacity,
deception, and exertion, of the <span class="smcap lowercase">DECOY-DUCK</span>,
by whose <i>wiles</i> and <i>allurements</i> the whole
flight are brought within the space allotted to their
destruction. The decoy-ducks are trained to their
business almost from the shell, and amply demonstrate
what services may be obtained, what fidelity
insured, or what attachment excited, by the exertion
of tenderness and humanity, even to the more
inferior parts of the creation.</p>

</div>

<p>It, however, often happens, that the wild fowl
are in such a state of sleepiness and dozing, that they
<span class="pagenum">{185}</span>
will not follow the decoy-ducks. Use is then generally
made of a dog trained to the business, who
passing backwards and forwards between the reed
screens, attracts the eye of the wild fowl, who not
choosing to be interrupted, advance towards the
<i>small</i> and <i>contemptible</i> animal, that they may drive
him away. The dog all the time, by the direction
of the <span class="smcap lowercase">DECOY-MAN</span>, plays among the screens of
reeds, <i>nearer</i> and <i>nearer</i> to the purse-net; till at
last the decoy-man appears behind the screen, and
the wild-fowl not daring to pass by him in <i>return</i>,
nor being able to escape upwards on account of the
net-covering, rush on into the <i>purse-net</i>.</p>

<p>The general season for catching fowl in decoys
is from the latter end of October till February: the
taking of them <i>earlier</i> is prohibited by an act 10th
of George II. which forbids it from June 1st to October
1st under the penalty of five shillings for
<i>each</i> bird destroyed within that space. An action
will lie against the disturber of a decoy, by <i>firing a
gun</i>, or any other act of <i>wilful</i> injury to the owner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Decoys</span> cannot be formed, nor need they be attempted,
but where nature has been a little diffuse
in her favors for the formation: marshy low lands,
plenty of water, and sequestered situations, are
indispensably necessary to a successful embarkation.
They are to be found in different parts of the kingdom,
but more plentiful in the northern and eastern
counties than in any other. Essex, Cambridgeshire,
<span class="pagenum">{186}</span>
Lincolnshire, and some part of Warwickshire, are
remarkable for many of considerable extent, and
from the principal of which the markets of the
Metropolis are so plentifully and so reasonably supplied.</p>

<span class="smcap lowercase">VENISON</span>, though very different
in size, flavour,
and estimation. <span class="smcap">Deer</span> are of two kinds;
the one principally bred and preserved for the chase,
the other for the table. A perfect description of
the first will be found under the proper heads of

<h3>DEER-STEALERS</h3><p>—are those nocturnal desperadoes
who, setting at defiance all laws, all possession
of property, and the protectors of it, disguise
themselves, and, under cover of the night,
attack, seize, kill, and carry away, from the best
fenced parks, <i>bucks</i> or <i>does</i>, (according to the season,)
with the greatest impunity. Their mainspring
of action is a dog of the cur kind, called
"a coney-cut lurcher:" this is a breed peculiar to
itself, and those who use it; being a light sort of
brindled wiry-haired mongrel, with a natural stump
tail, having the appearance of a <i>bastard</i> greyhound.
They are exceedingly fleet and lasting, run <i>mute</i>,
<span class="pagenum">{187}</span>
(by either <i>nose</i> or <i>sight</i>;) and are so well trained
for the purpose to which they are solely appropriated,
that they are equally expert in <i>picking up</i> a
<span class="smcap lowercase">HARE</span>, or <i>pulling down</i>
a <span class="smcap lowercase">BUCK</span>. After having executed
their office, though in the darkest night, they
will soon recover their master by <i>scent</i>, and lead
him to the <i>game</i> so pulled down, which is repeated
till a sufficiency is obtained for <i>that journey</i>; the business
having been so systematically conducted, by
the various neighbouring emissaries and associates
concerned, that horses and carts were employed,
and a regular routine of robbery carried on, by
periodical and alternate depredations upon most of
the parks within <i>fifty and sixty</i> miles of the Metropolis.
Many living in a line of respectability in
other respects, were publicly known to be employed
in the nefarious practice without fear of detection;
for no <i>informer</i> could come forward, without a very
great probability of destruction to his
<span class="smcap lowercase">PERSON</span> or
<i>property</i>, from some of the many confederates
concerned.</p>

</div>

<p>These offences, so long thought but little of, became
at length enormities of such magnitude, that the
Legislature discovered a necessity for the introduction
of new and more severe pains and penalties.
A variety of statutes were enacted in the reigns of
former sovereigns for the punishment of such offenders,
which are now fully concentrated in the
Acts of Parliament passed in the present reign of
George III.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{188}</div>

<p>By these statutes, if any persons shall hunt, or
take in a snare, kill or wound, any red or fallow deer,
in any forest, chase, &amp;c. whether inclosed or not,
or in any inclosed park, paddock, &amp;c. or be aiding
in such offence; they shall forfeit <i>twenty pounds</i> for
the first offence; and also <i>thirty pounds</i> for each
<span class="smcap lowercase">DEER</span> wounded, killed, or taken.
A <span class="smcap lowercase">GAME-KEEPER</span>,
guilty of either, to forfeit <i>double</i>. For a second
offence, the offenders may be transported for seven
years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Justices</span> may grant <i>warrants</i>
to search for heads,
skins, &amp;c. of stolen deer, and for toils, snares,
&amp;c. and persons having such in their possession, to
forfeit from <i>ten</i> to <i>thirty</i> pounds, at the discretion
of the justices. Persons unlawfully setting nets or
snares, to forfeit, for the first offence, from <i>five</i> to
<i>ten</i> pounds; and for every other offence, from <i>ten</i>
to <i>twenty</i> pounds. Persons pulling down pales or
fences of any forest, chase, park, paddock, wood,
&amp;c. subject to the penalties annexed to the first offence
for killing deer. <i>Dogs</i>, <i>guns</i>, and <i>engines</i>,
may be seized by the <span class="smcap lowercase">PARK-KEEPERS</span>;
and persons <i>resisting</i>, shall be transported for seven years.
<span class="smcap">Penalties</span>
may be levied by <i>distress</i>; in default of
which, offenders to be committed for <i>twelve months</i>.</p>

<p>Persons <i>disguised</i>, and <i>in arms</i>, appearing in
any forest, park, paddock, &amp;c. and killing red or
<i>fallow deer</i>, deemed felons without benefit of clergy.
<span class="pagenum">{189}</span>
Prosecutions limited to twelve months from the
time of the offence committed. Destroying goss,
furze, and fern, in forests and chases, being the covert
for deer, is liable to a penalty from <i>forty</i>
shillings to <i>five</i> pounds; to be levied by distress;
and if no distress, the offender to be committed to
the county gaol, for a time not greater than <i>three</i>
months, nor less than <i>one</i>.</p>

<h3>DEFAULT</h3><p>;—a term in hunting, which custom
has reduced to an abbreviation, and is in general
called <span class="smcap lowercase">FAULT</span>.
The hounds, during a chase of any
kind, when losing the scent, throwing up their noses,
seeming at a loss, and dashing different ways, in
anxious and earnest hope of recovery, are then said
to be at "<i>a fault</i>." This is the very moment when
the judgment of the huntsman is most required, and
the soonest to be observed. Different opinions have
been formed, and decisions made, respecting the
proper mode of proceeding at so critical a juncture,
whether to <i>try forward</i>, or to <i>try back</i>: here a great
deal depends upon the <span class="smcap lowercase">GAME</span>
you are <i>hunting of</i>,
and the country you are <i>hunting in</i>, which circumstances
at the time can only determine. However
opinions may vary upon some particular points,
all seem to coincide upon others; that the ground
should invariably be made good <i>forward</i>, previous
to trying <i>back</i>; that a general silence should prevail,
and not an unnecessary aspiration be heard,
that can tend to attract the attention of a single
<span class="pagenum">{190}</span>
hound from the earnest endeavours he is so busily
engaged in; by which means <i>nineteen</i> faults are hit
off out of <i>twenty</i>, without greater delay, suspense,
or disappointment.</p>

</div>

<p>If <span class="smcap lowercase">HOUNDS</span>, in pursuit of deer or fox,
<i>throw up</i> on a fallow or highway, they cannot be got forward
<i>too soon</i>; certain it is they have neither of them
stopt there: not so with the hare, who is likely to
have thrown herself out by the <i>side</i> of <i>one</i>, or
squatted in a land (or furrow) of the <i>other</i>. Faults
with the two former, are much more easily and expeditiously
<i>hit off</i> than with the latter, with whom
they are sometimes tediously incessant, particularly
with a young or a hard-hunted hare: it should
therefore, be a fixed rule, never to abandon a fault,
if possible, without <i>recovery</i>; it being as likely, at
least, to bring the lost hare to <i>a view</i>, as to find a
fresh one.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>DEFECTS</h3><p>—in horses differ very materially
from what are termed <span class="smcap lowercase">BLEMISHES</span>,
(which see:) the latter are always considered conspicuous, and easily
observed by the eye of experience and judicious
inspection. A horse may have <i>defects</i> not so readily
to be perceived, and consequently remain a
longer or shorter period before they are discovered:
he may prove incorrigibly restive, and not happen
to display it in a <i>new situation</i> for days or weeks;
he may be a <i>seasoned</i> and invincible <i>crib-biter</i>; he
<span class="pagenum">{191}</span>
may be vicious to dress; a kicker in the night;
doubtful in the <i>eyes</i>; aukward in action; troublesome
to <i>saddle</i>, and when saddled, more troublesome
to <i>ride</i>. Though these are defects, yet the
<span class="smcap lowercase">DEALER</span> (proceeding upon the
<i>purest</i> principles of
<i>integrity</i>) conceives them professional privileges of
<i>secrecy</i>, which he is not bound <i>in honor</i> to disclose;
affecting to believe, they are totally abstracted from
every idea conveyed in the declaration and warranty
of being "perfectly sound."</p>

</div>

<p>That this matter, however, may be the better
and more universally understood, it cannot be inapplicable
to introduce the opinion which the late
<span class="smcap">Lord Mansfield</span> held publicly in the Court of
King's Bench; "that a <i>restive</i> horse was tantamount
to an <i>unsound</i> one; and upon this principle,
that if the subject so purchased was evidently restive,
and <i>would not</i>, or <i>could not</i>, by <i>fair means</i>, be
prevailed upon to go where he was required,
he was equally <i>useless</i> with an invalid whose <i>lameness</i>
or infirmity prevented him from executing the
purposes for which he was purchased." From such
authority (founded upon the basis of equity) there
can be but little, if any, doubt, an action brought
for the recovery of money paid for a <i>restive</i> horse,
such horse having been "<span class="smcap lowercase">WARRANTED SOUND</span>,"
would obtain a verdict. As, however, the proverbial
<i>uncertainty</i> of the <span class="smcap lowercase">LAW</span>,
the confusion of
witnesses, and the caprice of a <i>sleepy</i> jury, are
<span class="pagenum">{192}</span>
very slender reliances for the man of prudence and
honor, who wishes "to do unto others as he would
be done unto," the safest method for every purchaser
is to take (from the <span class="smcap lowercase">GENTLEMAN</span>
as well as a <i>dealer</i>)
a proper receipt, upon payment of the money,
that such horse or mare is warranted sound and free
from vice; by which litigation and law-suits may
be prevented.</p>

was got by <i>Blank</i>. <i>Delpini</i> proved himself a
very capital racer, beating most of the best horses
of his year at all ages. He has also acquired some
celebrity as a <span class="smcap lowercase">STALLION</span>,

<h3>DIABETES</h3><p>,—divested of medical dignity, and
technical ambiguity, is neither more or less than a
profuse, frequent, and involuntary discharge of
urine, from a weakness of some of the parts necessary
to the secretion and evacuation of that particular
excrement. Whatever may have been the
<span class="pagenum">{193}</span>
cause, whether an injury in the loins, near the region
of the kidnies, violent and excessive purging from
improper physic, or a relaxed state of the sphincter
of the bladder, the road to relief and cure is still
the same; invigorants of every kind. Oatmeal
gruel for drink, instead of water, in which gum
arabic is dissolved, so that four or six ounces may
be taken every day; not submitting to which, half
an ounce, or six drachms of liquid laudanum, may
likewise be given in a little gruel, with a horn, every
night and morning.</p>

<h3>DIAMOND</h3><p>—was esteemed for some years the
speediest and best bottomed horse in the kingdom.
He was foaled in 1792; bred by Mr. Dawson; got
by <i>Highflyer</i> out of the dam of <i>Sparkler</i>, and
was own brother to <i>Screveton</i>. At three years
old he repeatedly ran in handsome with some of
the first horses, and was within a length of winning
the <i>Derby</i> at <span class="smcap">Epsom</span> when twelve started, but
did no more than receive 50 guineas forfeit from
<i>Lark</i> at the second <span class="smcap">Newmarket</span> Meeting of the
year 1795. First Spring Meeting, 1796, he won
the Jockey Stakes of 100 guineas each, six subscribers.
In the July Meeting of the same year
he <span class="smcap lowercase">WALKED OVER</span>
for a sweepstakes of 200 guineas
each, seven subscribers. In 1797, when <span class="smcap">Mr. Cookson's</span>,
he won the <span class="smcap">King's hundred</span> at
<span class="smcap">Newcastle</span>,
and a 50l. plate the next day at the same
place; 50l. at York; the 50 guineas for <i>all ages</i>
<span class="pagenum">{194}</span>
at <span class="smcap">Newmarket</span>, beating <i>Yeoman</i>,
<i>Play or Pay</i>, <i>Aimator</i>,
and others. The next day he won the
<span class="smcap">King's hundred guineas</span>, beating the
famous <i>Hermione</i>
and <i>Vixen</i>. In 1798 he beat <i>Moorcock</i>,
over the Beacon Course, for 200 guineas, Monday
in the Craven Meeting. First Spring Meeting
he won a sweepstakes of 100 guineas each, twelve
subscribers. Second Meeting, received a compromise
from <span class="smcap">Lord Clermont's</span> <i>Spoliator</i>.
At <span class="smcap">Oxford</span>
he won the <span class="smcap lowercase">GOLD CUP</span> of 100 guineas value,
with 50 guineas in specie, beating <i>Stickler</i>, <i>Johnny</i>,
<i>Oatlands</i>, and <i>Whip</i>; all excellent runners.
The <span class="smcap">King's hundred</span> at
<span class="smcap">Nottingham</span>; the <span class="smcap">King's hundred</span>
at <span class="smcap">York</span>; and beat
<span class="smcap">Sir H. T. Vane's</span>
<i>Shuttle</i> four miles over <span class="smcap">Doncaster</span>
for 1000 guineas:
the odds eleven to eight upon <i>Shuttle</i>. In
1799 he was beat <i>half a length</i> the great match by
<i>Hambletonian</i>, over the Beacon Course at <span class="smcap">Newmarket</span>,
for 3000 guineas; the odds five to four
upon Hambletonian. More money was sported
upon this match, and more company went from the
Metropolis to see it decided, than ever was known
upon any other race in the kingdom. The next
day he won the first class of the <span class="smcap">Oatlands stakes</span>
50 guineas each (ten subscribers) beating eight
of the best horses of the year. First Spring
Meeting he won the <span class="smcap">King's hundred</span>, beating
<i>Grey Pilot</i>, <i>Lounger</i>, and <i>St. George</i>. Second
Meeting won the Jockey Club plate, and 50 guineas,
beating <i>Stamford</i> and <i>Lounger</i>. In 1800, First
<span class="pagenum">{195}</span>
Spring Meeting, he won a subscription 50<i>l.</i> beating
<i>Stamford</i>, the <i>famous Coriander</i>, and <i>Wrangler</i>.
First October Meeting he received 250 guineas <i>forfeit</i>
from <i>Warter</i>. Second October Meeting he beat <i>Hippona</i>
over the Beacon Course, 200 guineas. Here ended
his career of <span class="smcap lowercase">GLORY</span>
by the <i>death</i> of <span class="smcap">Mr. Cookson</span>;
after which he was sold, and taken to <span class="smcap">Ireland</span>;
where being engaged by his owner in a match of
much magnitude, he was <span class="smcap lowercase">LAMED</span>
by <i>over training</i>
in another country, after running <i>five successive</i>
years in this, without being lame, or having paid
<span class="smcap lowercase">FORFEIT</span> from indisposition,

<h3>DIET</h3><p>.—The diet of horses in this country is
now so universally known, that very little is required
upon the subject of explanation under this
head. The articles called <i>oats</i>, <i>beans</i>, <i>hay</i>, <i>bran</i>,
<i>chaff</i>, <i>carrots</i>, and <i>grains</i>, are individually brought
into use, as may best coincide with the pecuniary
propensities, or liberal sensations, of the owners.
Whatever may be written upon the subject of <i>quantity</i>
and <i>quality</i>, will very little influence the enquirers
upon those heads; the <span class="smcap lowercase">GENTLEMAN</span> and the
<span class="smcap lowercase">SPORTSMAN</span> will never alter
their invariable plan of
<i>plenty</i>, and of the <i>best quality</i>; but the long list
of coachmasters, postmasters, job and hackney-men,
carmen, carriers, and inferior tradesmen,
who merely <i>exist</i>, under the unavoidable accumulation
of taxes, cannot <i>feed</i> their horses as <i>they
would</i>, but are compelled to feed them <i>as they can</i>.
No particular instructions, therefore, become materially
<span class="pagenum">{196}</span>
necessary; but some general rules may be laid
down for occasional recollection.</p>

</div>

<p>The management of horses of every description,
whether for the turf, the field, or the road, is
now so systematically understood by the different
classes of society, that nothing new, instructive,
or entertaining, can be introduced under that
head. Each horse is supported in a way (at least
in respect to <i>quantity</i> and <i>quality</i> of food) individually,
and regulated by the opinion of the owner, or
the work he has to perform. One conceives, from
his own sensations of liberality, even <i>four</i> feeds of
corn a day <i>too little</i>; another considers <i>two</i> rather
<i>too much</i>. In such contrariety and diversity, who
can expect to see opinions concentrate in one
particular point? Such hope, if adopted, will be
eternally disappointed. It may not be inapplicable
to have it always in memory, that it is not
the <i>number</i> of feeds, or the <i>quantity</i> of hay, that
should constitute the criterion, but the <i>quality</i>
of both upon which the nutritious support entirely
depends. <i>Three</i> measures of good corn will
contribute more nutriment to the frame, and invigoration
to the system, than <i>five</i> of <i>bad</i>: and twenty-eight
pounds of substantial fragrant hay will
at all times be more prudent, and more profitable,
than even double the quantity of a very <i>inferior</i>
quality.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{197}</div>

<p>This <i>data</i> judiciously and occasionally adverted
to, will sufficiently widen the ground of information
to every comprehension; it being only necessary to
hold in memory the additional circumstance, that
horses fed too high, without proportional work,
exercise, and evacuations, must become <i>full</i>, <i>plethoric</i>,
and ultimately disordered; while, on the contrary,
those whose blood is permitted to become
impoverished from a want of the necessary supply
of <span class="smcap lowercase">FOOD</span>, will soon
display it in a wasting of the

originating in a serious and acrimonious state of the

<h3>DIOMED</h3><p>—was in great repute as a racer, and
afterwards as <span class="smcap lowercase">A STALLION</span> at ten guineas a mare.
He was bred by Sir <span class="smcap">C. Bunbury</span>; got by <i>Florizel</i>;
dam by <i>Spectator</i>, and grand-dam by <i>Blank</i>; was
foaled in 1777, and proved himself an equal runner
with the best horse of his time. As a stallion, he
has propagated some of the finest stock in the kingdom.
<span class="smcap">Diomed</span> is the sire of <i>Anthony</i>, <i>Charlotte</i>,
<i>Grey Diomed</i>, <i>Laïs</i>, <i>Mademoiselle</i>, <i>Playfellow</i>,
<i>Quetlavaca</i>,

<h3>DISEASE</h3><p>—is not only a state of the body directly
opposite to the standard of health, but may
be defined of two kinds; as those with which we are
afflicted by the influence of a superior Power, whose
wisdom we are not permitted to explore; and by
others that, in acts of <i>neglect</i> and <i>indiscretion</i>, we
bring upon ourselves. Diseases are differently
conceived: some writers describe them by their
<i>cause</i>, some by their <i>effect</i>: leaving the investigation
in a kind of medical mystery, bearing no ill affinity
to theological ambiguity. In fact, the word is only
introduced here to remind every reader, that, in respect
to both <span class="smcap lowercase">MAN</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">HORSE</span>, prevention is preferable
to <span class="smcap lowercase">CURE</span>.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>DISTANCE</h3><p>;—a sporting term appertaining
solely to the <span class="smcap lowercase">TURF</span>.
It is a length of <i>two hundred
and forty</i> yards (actual measurement) from the
<span class="smcap lowercase">WINNING-POST</span>
of every <span class="smcap lowercase">RACE-COURSE</span> in the kingdom;
precisely at which spot is fixed a post corresponding
with others, but having a gallery annexed capable
of holding three or four persons, which is called the
<span class="smcap lowercase">DISTANCE-POST</span>.
In this gallery, as well as in the
gallery of the winning-post, before the horses start
each heat, is stationed a person holding a crimson
flag; during the time the horses are running, each
flag is suspended from the front of the gallery to
<span class="pagenum">{199}</span>
which it has been appropriated; but immediately
upon the first horse passing the holder of the flag in
the gallery of the <span class="smcap lowercase">WINNING-POST</span>,
he strikes <span class="smcap lowercase">THE FLAG</span>;
at the <i>very moment</i> of his doing which,
the holder of the flag in the gallery of the distance-post
strikes his <i>also</i>, in confirmation that the heat
is decided; and such <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSE</span>
or <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSES</span> (running for
the plate) as may not have passed the
<span class="smcap lowercase">DISTANCE-POST</span>
before the <i>flag is struck</i>, is then deemed a <i>distanced</i>
horse, and disqualified from <i>starting again</i> for
the same <span class="smcap lowercase">PLATE</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">PRIZE</span>. A horse running on
the <i>wrong side</i> of a <span class="smcap lowercase">POST</span>,
the <span class="smcap lowercase">RIDER</span> not bringing his
proper and full weight <i>to scale</i> after the heat, or dismounting
without first riding <span class="smcap lowercase">HIS HORSE</span> up to the
side of the <i>scale</i>, and <i>weighing</i>, are also deemed <i>distanced</i>
horses, and not permitted to start again.</p>

<h3>DIURETICS</h3><p>.—The class of medicines so called,
are those which, by their peculiar stimulus, act solely
upon the parts appropriated to the secretion of
urine and its evacuation; thereby relieving the frame
from such impurities, or slight disorders as pass under
the denomination of <span class="smcap lowercase">HUMOURS</span>, and are said to
originate in the state of the blood. The advertised
diuretic balls of the Author are recommended and
established for their well-known efficacy in "cracks,
scratches, inflammation of the eyes, perceptible
foulness, swelled legs, and grease." <span class="smcap">Diuretics</span> are
the more useful and convenient, because a horse can
<span class="pagenum">{200}</span>
be <i>moderately</i> used at any time during their operation.</p>

<h3>DOE</h3><p>—is the female of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">FALLOW DEER</span>, bred
in <span class="smcap lowercase">PARKS</span>, and are the species
from which the table
is supplied with venison: the male is called
<span class="smcap lowercase">A BUCK</span>;
the female, <span class="smcap lowercase">A DOE</span>:
the young (of which they produce
but one annually) is called <span class="smcap lowercase">A FAWN</span>.
Doe venison is not considered equal in epicurean estimation
with the buck, either in <i>fat</i> or <i>flavour</i>; nor is
it in season till the latter has declined: this happens
at the beginning of autumn, when the season for copulation
(called <i>rutting time</i>) comes on. <span class="smcap">Fawns</span>
are killed for the table at three months old, consequently
in use during the latter end of August, and
first weeks of September.</p>

<h3>DOGS</h3><p>,—that well-known species of animal
whose fidelity, attachment, gratitude, and general
utility, very far exceed every eulogium within the
power of the profuse pen of admiration to bestow.
Their virtues and useful qualifications are beyond
the most prolific description: they are the protectors
of our property at home, the promoters of our
pleasures abroad, and the pleasing partners of our
domestic comforts by the fire-side. The <span class="smcap">Rev. Mr. Daniel</span>,
in his elegant production called "Rural
Sports," has given a very full and satisfactory
historical account of their origin, the different kinds
and crosses, with instances, and well authenticated
<span class="pagenum">{201}</span>
proofs, of their mutual affection, fidelity, sagacity,
and docility. He has also introduced "a laughable
philosophical account of dogs, under the supposition
of a transmigration of souls;" with a great variety
of matter, truly entertaining to the <span class="smcap lowercase">SPORTSMAN</span>
of curious investigation.</p>

</div>

<p>In the reign of Queen Elizabeth was published
a systematical arrangement of the different kind of
dogs peculiar to Britain; but many of the names by
which they were known, having since become obsolete,
they have been most judiciously classed by
Mr. Daniel under the following genealogical heads.
1. <i>Shepherds' Dog</i>; <i>Wolf Dog</i>; <i>Iceland Dog</i>; <i>Lapland
Dog</i>; <i>Siberian Dog</i>.—2. <i>Hound</i>; <i>Harrier</i>;
<i>Terrier</i>.—3. <i>Large Spaniel</i>; <i>Small Spaniel</i>; <i>Water
Dog</i>; <i>Small Water Dog</i>.—4. <i>Bull Dog.</i>—5. <i>Large
Danish Dog</i>; <i>Irish Greyhound</i>; <i>Great Hound Mongrel</i>;
<i>Large Greyhound</i>; <i>English Greyhound</i>; and
lastly, the <i>Mastiff Dog</i>. When, after an investigation
so seemingly clear, and a description so truly
systematic, every sportsman must be equally surprised,
that there is no collateral branch of the "Genealogical
Table," by which the <span class="smcap">Pointer</span> has been
produced; so that, with both these Authors, his <i>ab
origine</i>, or <i>unde derivatur</i>, is left in equal obscurity.</p>

<p>As the qualification of each particular sporting
dog will be more minutely adverted to under the
distinct heads of <span class="smcap">Hound</span>,
<span class="smcap">Greyhound</span>, <span class="smcap">Pointer</span>,
<span class="smcap">Terrier</span>, &amp;c. it becomes only applicable here, to
<span class="pagenum">{202}</span>
introduce such useful remarks as appertain to the
species in general, under the separate fatalities of
<span class="smcap lowercase">MADNESS</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">DISEASES</span>.</p>

<p>The signs of madness in a dog are as follow:
He becomes dull, solitary, and endeavours to hide
himself: he seldom barks, but makes a kind of
murmuring noise, and refuses all kinds of meat and
drink: he is enraged at, and flies upon, strangers;
but in this stage he remembers and respects his master:
his ears and head hang down; he walks nodding,
as if overpowered with sleep: this is the first
stage; and <i>a bite</i> now, though dangerous, is not so
bad as afterwards. After these symptoms, the dog
begins to pant; he breathes quick and heavy; hangs
out his tongue, to emit a great deal of froth from
his mouth, which he keeps perpetually open: sometimes
he walks slowly, and as if half asleep, and then
suddenly runs, but not always directly forward, as
pretended: at length he forgets his master; his eyes
look dispirited, dull, full of tears, and red; his
tongue is of a lead colour, he grows faint and
weak; oft reels, staggers, and falls; then rises suddenly,
and attempts to fly at every thing, becoming
now mad and furious: this second stage seldom continues
thirty hours, death putting by that time an
end to the disease: and a bite received during the
last stage is justly considered incurable. To these
distinguishing traits of the dreadful malady, may
be added the following, which are believed certain
<span class="pagenum">{203}</span>
and invariable. All other dogs are alarmed at the
approach of a dog <i>really mad</i>, and, upon smelling
him, not only <i>instantly</i> avoid him, but run away
with horror. The tone of the dog's voice when he
barks, seems hoarse and hollow. In the dumb
madness, if the dog is confined, he barks incessantly
for a day or two.</p>

<p>Those who wish to go into a most ingenious and
explanatory investigation of madness, and its <i>different
kinds</i> in dogs, will feel themselves highly
gratified in a perusal of that part of <span class="smcap">Mr. Daniel's</span>
"Rural Sports," who has systematically introduced
the best and most judicious opinions and authorities
upon the subject.</p>

<p>The disease occasioned by the bite of a mad dog
is called <span class="smcap lowercase">HYDROPHOBIA</span>;
and the smallest quantity
of his saliva, either <i>fresh</i> or <i>dry</i>, will produce it.
The infection frequently lies dormant for many
months, and then displays itself with the greatest
violence; but, in general, it appears from a month
to six weeks, at the expiration of which, if no
symptoms of disorder are perceptible, the patient
is considered to be safe, and not to have received
the infection. It has been thought by the best medical
authority, that the nearer the place bitten is to
the salivary glands, the sooner the symptoms appear;
and this, by observation and experience, is
now fully confirmed.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{204}</div>

<p>In order to communicate the infection, a wound
is no more necessary than it is in the small-pox;
to the <span class="smcap lowercase">HUMAN SPECIES</span> it can be communicated by
the <i>saliva</i> only; but <i>dogs</i> have received it by being
in the <span class="smcap lowercase">KENNEL</span> where <i>mad dogs</i>
have been before.
This disorder, it seems, is only inherent and natural
to the canine species, (as the dog, fox, and wolf;)
but other animals having received the infection, by
the puncture of the tooth from either of those, may
then communicate it to any other species, and by
the same means.</p>

<p>When the human species become unhappily the
subjects of this disorder, though in particular instances
some variation may be observed, the symptoms
are in general a slight pain in the wound,
sometimes attended with <i>itching</i>, but always resembling
a rheumatic pain; it extends also into the
neighbouring parts, and at length from the extremities
it passes into the viscera; the cicatrix (if
there has been a wound) begins to swell, inflames,
and then to discharge an ichor; and this <i>alone</i>
may be considered the primary and invariable symptom
of a certain hydrophobia. There are other
more general pains, resembling rheumatic ones,
and are of a quick, flying, convulsive kind: they
affect the patient in the neck, joints, and other
parts; a dull pain often seizes the head, neck,
breast, belly, and even runs along the back-bone.
The patient is gloomy, murmurs much, is forgetful,
<span class="pagenum">{205}</span>
and drowsy; at times the mind seems disordered;
by turns he is watchful; his slumbers become disturbed,
and awaking from them, convulsive agitations
immediately follow.</p>

<p>A deafness is sometimes complained of; the eyes
are watery, the aspect sorrowful; the face becomes
pale and contracted; sweat also breaks out about
the temples: an unusual flow of saliva at length
comes on, with a dryness of the fauces, a foulness
of the tongue, and a disagreeable, or rather fœtid,
effluvia from the breath. As the above symptoms
increase, the second stage advances: a fever comes
on, which at first is mild, but attended with momentary
horrors, and violent periodical agitations;
wakefulness becomes continual; the mind is more
and more disturbed; a delirium approaches; and
an aversion to <i>fluids</i> and <i>polished</i> bodies is at this
time plainly perceptible. At first, a constriction
of the gullet is perceived, and a difficulty of swallowing;
but as yet liquids are freely taken, although
soon refused: this symptom augments so
visibly, that, when any <i>liquid</i> comes before their
sight, an horror immediately seizes them; and if
they make an effort to drink, spasms are produced,
on which horrid gesticulations, and loss of senses,
follow. The patient now murmurs, groans, and
mourns most distressingly, loses by degrees all
knowledge of his most intimate acquaintance, and
then becomes <i>desirous</i> of <i>biting</i>: reason returns at
<span class="pagenum">{206}</span>
intervals, and he laments his own calamity; the
thirst excites a desire to drink, but in vain they
strive, and soon sink into the most affecting despondency.
Conscious of the approaching inclination
to <i>bite</i>, he warns his friends of their danger, and,
by words or motions, advises them to keep at a
distance. Toward the conclusion, the fever and
thirst increase, the tongue hangs out, the mouth
foams, strength fails, cold sweats come on, the
tightness in the breast increases, as well as all the
predominant symptoms, till the patient expires in
strong convulsions.</p>

<p>The subject of <span class="smcap lowercase">MADNESS</span> in
<span class="smcap lowercase">DOGS</span>, and the
<span class="smcap lowercase">HYDROPHOBIA</span>
in the human species, afford ample scope
for reflection and scientific disquisition: this, however,
not being the proper place for a literary enlargement
upon either, it becomes necessary to introduce
a few remarks upon that well known destructive
disorder called "<span class="smcap lowercase">THE DISTEMPER</span>," which
Mr. Daniel properly observes, "is the most fatal
(the plague only excepted) that any animal is subject
to. It is astonishing what numbers have been
destroyed by it within the period of its being known
in this country, which is about forty years: whether
the attention paid, and the medicines of different
kinds now usually administered in its first stages,
have occasioned the alteration, certain it is, the
disease is milder, and less frequent, than it was
twelve or fifteen years since."</p>

<div class="pagenum">{207}</div>

<p>After all the dissections and minute investigations
that can possibly be made, <i>the distemper</i>, in
respect to its original or remote cause, sets every
enquiry at defiance; and it remains in the same
state of uncertainty in which it has continued for
thirty years past. Great and indefatigable exertions,
however, on the part of <span class="smcap">Mr. Blaine</span>, (a
professional gentleman of anatomical and medical
celebrity,) have done much in the investigation;
and as his researches are constant and unwearied,
the <span class="smcap lowercase">SPORTING WORLD</span>
have yet much to expect from
his perseverance. Mr. B. most candidly observes,
that, "amidst all his investigations, although unable
to discover the original cause of the disease,
and after many experiments made upon probable
ground to provide a cure for it, what enquiry,
conducted on principles of reason and science,
could not do, was effected by <i>chance</i>; and a remedy
was found as certain in its effects, as it is possible
for a remedy to be. Under a fair trial it has
never been known to fail; even in the worst stages,
when the convulsions were very frequent, it has removed
the complaint; yet, where the disease is so
malignant, the certainty must be diminished."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Beckford</span>, whose series of "Letters upon
Hunting" are amongst the happiest efforts of truth
and accurate observation, communicates a remedy
for the distemper, transmitted to him by a friend
whose hounds had derived great benefit from the
<span class="pagenum">{208}</span>
experiment, of taking "an ounce of Peruvian
bark in a glass of port wine twice every day;"
whether as a <i>ball</i> or <i>bolus</i> does not appear; but,
perhaps, upon trial, it will be found, that <i>an
ounce</i> of bark in powder will absorb (or take up)
<i>four</i> glasses of wine, before it can be rendered
sufficiently <i>fluid</i> for administering in that form.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Daniel</span> has so largely and judiciously
treated upon the subjects of the <i>distemper</i> and <i>canine
madness</i> in his <span class="smcap">Rural Sports</span>, that it is impossible
to add a single thought or line upon either,
without the most palpable appearance of
plagiarism: his own observations, blended with a
collection of well-authenticated facts, are so numerous,
so just, and the inferences drawn so truly
scientific, that nothing new or additionally advantageous
can be introduced.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dogs</span> of every description are held in such general
estimation, that the Legislature has thought
proper to render the <i>privilege</i> of <i>keeping them</i>
a matter of pecuniary contribution to the support
of government, and the exigencies of the state;
under which increased and accumulated act, they
are become very efficient objects of taxation, as
will be readily conceived by the annexed abstract.</p>

<p>"Persons keeping <i>one</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">DOG</span>,
not passing under the
denomination of <span class="smcap lowercase">GREYHOUND</span>,

<p>"Any person keeping <i>one</i> or <i>more</i> dogs, of either of the

<p><span class="smcap">Dogs</span>, from their general utility, and the estimation
they are invariably held in by their owners,
have been thought worthy an <span class="smcap lowercase">ACT</span> of
<span class="smcap lowercase">PARLIAMENT</span>
formed solely for their protection; rendering them
of proportional value with any other kind of
property, and equally entitled to legal preservation.
By this statute it is enacted, "If any person
shall steal any <i>dog</i>, or <i>dogs</i>, of any kind or
sort whatsoever, from the owner thereof, or from
any person entrusted by the owner thereof with
such dog or dogs; or shall sell, buy, receive,
harbour, detain, or keep any dogs of any kind or sort
whatsoever, knowing the same to have been <i>stolen</i>
as aforesaid; every such person being convicted
thereof upon the oath of one credible witness, before
two <span class="smcap">Justices of the Peace</span>, shall for the first
offence forfeit and pay any sum not exceeding 30l.
nor less than 20l. and the charges of conviction."</p>

<div class="pagenum">{210}</div>

<p>And "in case such penalty shall not be forthwith
paid, the offender to be committed to gaol
for any time not exceeding <i>twelve</i> months, nor less

Any person guilty of a subsequent offence, to
forfeit and pay any sum not exceeding 50l. nor
less than 30l. together with the charges; which
penalties to be paid, one moiety thereof to the
informer, and the other to the poor of the parish.
On non-payment, the offender to be imprisoned
for any time not exceeding eighteen months, nor
less than twelve, or until the penalty and charges
shall be paid, and be publicly whipped. Justices
may grant warrants to search for dogs stolen; and
in case any such dog or dogs, or their skins, shall,
upon such search, be found, to take and restore
every such dog or skin to the owner; and the persons
in whose custody any such dog or skin shall
be found, are liable to the like penalties and punishments.
Persons aggrieved may appeal to the
quarter-sessions, and the determination there to be
final."</p>

<h3>DOCKING</h3><p>.—The amputation of the tail is so
called, from that part of the tail left to the body
being called the <span class="smcap lowercase">DOCK</span>.
It is a very short and simple
operation, attended with no danger, and may
with yearlings be performed even with a common
knife. A very slight cauterization with a hot-iron,
and a little powdered rosin, immediately stops the
<span class="pagenum">{211}</span>
bleeding, and a cure takes place in a few days.
It was formerly a custom to dock horses <i>close</i>
to the quarters, under the erroneous and ridiculous
impression of making the horse strong in the spine:
such idea and practice are, however, in the present
more enlightened age, entirely relinquished.</p>

<h3>DOUBLE</h3><p>—a term in <span class="smcap lowercase">HARE HUNTING</span>. The
hare is said to double, when, being considerably ahead
of the hounds, she throws herself to the right
or left, and returns in a parallel line to the track
she went before; getting into which, she is said to
<i>run the foil</i>. If during the chase the lays down,
she is then said <i>to quat</i>.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>DRAG</h3><p>—is a sporting term in
<span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTING</span>, and
used exactly in the same sense with
<span class="smcap lowercase">THE FOX</span>, as
<i>trail</i> is with <span class="smcap lowercase">THE HARE</span>.
Upon throwing <span class="smcap lowercase">THE HOUNDS</span>
into <i>covert</i>, to <i>draw</i> for a <span class="smcap lowercase">FOX</span>,
any single
hound <i>giving tongue</i>, is said to
<span class="smcap lowercase">CHALLENGE</span>, and to
have hit upon <i>drag</i>; that is, to have come upon the
<i>foot</i> or <i>scent</i> of the fox, where he had been in the
night or early part of the morning, before he retired
to secrete himself for the day. When it was
the custom to be at the covert side so soon as there
was day-light sufficient to <span class="smcap lowercase">RIDE</span>
up to the <span class="smcap lowercase">HOUNDS</span>,
drag was <i>speedily</i> obtained; and in many instances
a <span class="smcap lowercase">GOOD DRAG</span> proved better than
a <i>bad chase</i>; but
in the present fashion of going to covert, and
throwing off at <i>mid-day</i>, drag is but very little
<span class="pagenum">{212}</span>
known, and but of trifling use if found; for the
<span class="smcap lowercase">SCENT</span> must, from the great length of time, have
so generally <i>died away</i>, and so partially remained,
that no expectation can be entertained of
<span class="smcap lowercase">THE HOUNDS</span>
carrying it up to <span class="smcap lowercase">THE GAME</span>.</p>

<h3>DRAG-NET</h3><p>—is the particular <span class="smcap lowercase">NET</span>
in use with
those nocturnal depredators who exert their utmost
endeavours to devastate every water in the neighbourhood
where they reside. It is of sufficient
length to extend from one side of any moderate
<i>pond</i>, <i>moat</i>, or <i>river</i>, to the other; and having the
bottom plentifully loaded with leads at equal distances,
with the addition of assistants at each end
to bring the two together, encloses of course all
the fish within its draught.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3><span class="smcap">DRAUGHT or Draft Horses</span></h3><p>—are of two
kinds; the one adapted to the light carriages and
splendid trappings of the great; the other to the
purposes of agriculture, and the commercial transactions
of the Metropolis, where their numbers,
their strength, and powerful execution, exceed
every idea of the most fertile imagination. See

<div class="combine">

<h3>DRAWING</h3><p>—is a term used in <span class="smcap lowercase">FOX</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">STAG HUNTING</span>,
when <i>drawing a covert</i> to find either of the
former, or an outlying deer; it being customary
to say, "we <i>draw</i> for <span class="smcap lowercase">A FOX</span>;"
"we <i>try</i> for <span class="smcap lowercase">A HARE</span>."</p>

<h3>DRAW-NET</h3><p>—is used for taking birds of different
kinds, but more particularly applied to the
net made use of with the <span class="smcap lowercase">SETTING DOG</span> for taking
<span class="smcap lowercase">PARTRIDGES</span>, by which mode the whole
<span class="smcap lowercase">COVEY</span> are
frequently secured. The old birds are liberated,
and the young destined to the table. This is,
however, considered so <i>destructive</i> and <i>unfair</i> a
practice, that it is continued but by very few, and
those principally consist of <span class="smcap lowercase">RUSTIC TYRANTS</span>, or
<i>rigid Cynics</i>, who wish to monopolize not only the
<span class="smcap lowercase">SPORT</span> and the
<span class="smcap lowercase">GAME</span>, but all the good things of this
life.</p>

<h3>DRAY</h3><p>.—A squirrel's deposit for its young is

<h3><span class="smcap">DRENCH, or Drink</span></h3><p>,—any medical composition
prepared in a liquid form, and given to
horses or cattle for the cure of disease. A distinction
is made between the two in general; it being
the custom to say, <span class="smcap lowercase">DRINK</span> for a
<span class="smcap lowercase">HORSE</span>, <i>drench</i> for
a <i>cow</i>. They are given with a horn, sold by saddlers
and collar-makers for that purpose.</p>

<h3>DRIFT</h3><p>—is the act of driving
<span class="smcap lowercase">A COMMON</span>. This
ceremony takes place <i>once</i>, <i>twice</i>, or <i>thrice</i>, a year,
(according to the custom of the place,) to insure
and continue the privilege of the <span class="smcap">Lord of the Manor</span>,
as well as to preserve the rights of the
<span class="pagenum">{214}</span>
parishioners. The cattle upon the <span class="smcap lowercase">COMMONS</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">WASTES</span> being all driven to some particular spot,
are there examined, and their owners ascertained:
those belonging to parishioners (or such as have
<i>right of common</i>) are immediately liberated, and
return to their old <i>lair</i>: others, the property of
<span class="smcap lowercase">ALIENS</span>, are impounded,
and the owner is <i>fined</i> such
reasonable sum as may be thought equitable by
the <span class="smcap lowercase">BAILIFF</span> of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">MANOR</span>. No owner being
found, the object (whatever it be) is called an
<i>estray</i>, which being cried three times in the nearest
market-towns, and not claimed within twelve
months and a day, it then becomes the property of
the <span class="smcap lowercase">LORD</span> of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">MANOR</span>.</p>

<h3>DRIVER</h3><p>,—a name given to many famous
horses, but of very different blood. The first
was foaled in 1727, bred by the <span class="smcap">Duke of Ancaster</span>,
and got by the Wynn Arabian, of no great
note. <span class="smcap">Mr. Beaver's</span> <i>Driver</i> was foaled 1732, and
got by <i>Snake</i> out of <span class="smcap">Thwaites's</span> dun mare.
<span class="smcap">Mr. Lamego's</span>
<i>Driver</i> (commonly called <i>Little Driver</i>)
was got by <span class="smcap">Beaver's</span> <i>Driver</i>;
dam by <i>Childers</i>;
grand-dam by the <i>Walpole</i> Barb; was foaled in 1743;
and for some years proved one of the best plate horses
in the kingdom, having won upwards of <i>thirty fifties</i>;
but as a stallion never produced any winners.
<span class="smcap">Lord Egremont's</span> <i>Driver</i>, foaled in 1783, was
got by <i>Trentham</i>, dam (<i>Coquette</i>) by the Compton
Barb, and proved a tolerable runner.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">DROPSY of the Chest</span></h3><p>—is a disorder to which
horses are subject; and many instances have occurred
in the practice of the Author, where seven,
eight, and in one case near ten gallons of water were
found in the <span class="smcap lowercase">CAVITY</span> of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">CHEST</span>, upon opening the
body after death. This accumulation of fluid being
completely extravasated, no hope of cure can be
entertained, as the preternatural collection can neither
be taken up by absorption, or carried off by
evacuation. There seems to be only one predominant
trait, or distinguishing symptom, by which
this disorder can be even tolerably ascertained, and
that is solely by the <span class="smcap lowercase">ACTION</span>
of the <i>horse</i>. In either
walk, trot, or gallop, (and the more as his pace
is increased in each,) the fore legs seemingly spread
from each other, as if they were internally distended
by painful pressure, similar to division by forcible
expansion, not at all unlike the means used
by butchers in the stick pointed at each end to
extend the limbs of carcases when displayed for
sale. The legs in a trot constitute a <i>painful hobble</i>;
and in a <span class="smcap lowercase">GALLOP</span> the subject
cannot get his legs before
him, but appears at every motion likely to
pitch upon his head. All this gives every reason
to believe the defect, when first discovered, is frequently
thought a lameness in the shoulder, and the
patient presently deemed a chest-foundered horse.
If a horse having a <span class="smcap lowercase">DROPSY</span>
in the <span class="smcap lowercase">CHEST</span>, and the
collection of water (from the duration of disease) is
large, much information may be derived respecting
<span class="pagenum">{216}</span>
the certainty, by the following experiment. Lead,
or let him be rode up a gentle <i>ascent</i>, and he will
be observed to move with but very little pain or
impediment: the moment he is turned round, and
<i>descends</i>, the weight of the water in the chest coming
forward, and being pressed upon by the contents of
the abdomen, in the action of going <i>down hill</i>, instantly
produces so much pain, and such difficulty
of proceeding, that with judicious practitioners,
or nice observers, no great hesitation can arise in
pronouncing the probable <span class="smcap lowercase">CERTAINTY</span>
of this <i>disease</i>.</p>

<h3>DRUGS</h3><p>.—The parts of the <span class="smcap lowercase">MATERIA MEDICA</span>
are so called in their individual state, previous to
their incorporation with each other, when they then
become <span class="smcap lowercase">CHEMICALS</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">GALENICALS</span>, according to
the different processes they have undergone; and
the most eminent commercial houses in that way,
announce themselves dealers in "Chemicals, Galenicals,
and Drugs." There is nothing requires
more the scrutinizing eye of the <span class="smcap lowercase">SPORTSMAN</span>,
or the judicious exertion of the <span class="smcap lowercase">VETERINARIAN</span>,
than the <i>selection</i> of <span class="smcap lowercase">MEDICINES</span>;
upon the pure and unadulterated
properties of which, he has alone to depend
for the foundation of all his hopes, the gratification
of all his wishes, and the support of all his professional
reputation.</p>

</div>

<p>It is a matter too universally known to require
much information, that <span class="smcap lowercase">DRUGS</span>
of different kinds
<span class="pagenum">{217}</span>
(or qualities) are sold under the <i>same</i> denomination
at <i>various</i> prices; by which the prudent and the
experienced may easily judge of the gradational
shades of <span class="smcap lowercase">ADULTERATION</span>
by which those <i>prices</i> are
reduced. The lower class of <span class="smcap lowercase">FARRIERS</span>,
particularly in the country, are remarkable for purchasing
the <i>cheapest</i> articles they can obtain, and have of
course the regular channels through which they
are supplied. The paltry articles sold for
<span class="smcap lowercase">LIQUORICE POWDER</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">DIAPENTE</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">FŒNUGREC</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">ANISEED POWDER</span>,
and <span class="smcap lowercase">TURMERIC</span>, are mostly a compound of
<i>flour</i>, <i>bean meal</i>, <i>oatmeal</i>, and various kinds of <i>rubbish</i>,
slightly impregnated with a small proportion
of the genuine drug or medicine it is intended to
represent. See <span class="smcap">Adulteration</span>.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap lowercase">DRUGS</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">MEDICINES</span> indispensibly necessary
for the professional embarkation of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">VETERINARIAN</span>,

possession of which, it will be impossible to do justice
to the good opinion of his employers, or to

and the preservation of their studs in good

<h3>DUBBING</h3><p>.—Taking off the <span class="smcap lowercase">COMB</span>
and <span class="smcap lowercase">GILLS</span>
from a game chick, before he is turned to a master-walk,
is so called. The operation is performed
with a penknife for the <i>comb</i>, and scissars for the

<h3>DULNESS</h3><p>—in a horse of any tolerable spirit,
may be considered an <i>infallible</i> sign of present disquietude,
or approaching <span class="smcap lowercase">DISEASE</span>. In all cases,
accurate investigation, and early relief, are much to
be commended: even a <i>slight cold</i> attended to at
its <i>commencement</i>, may be prevented from speedily
producing an <span class="smcap lowercase">INFLAMMATION</span>

<h3>DUNG</h3><p>.—The excrement of the horse is so
<span class="pagenum">{220}</span>
called, and should be occasionally attended to, as
its appearance will sometimes tend to the prevention
of disease. If the dung is bright in colour,
the globules uniform in shape and consistence, and
not <i>fœtid</i> in <i>effluvia</i>, the body may be considered in
good state: on the contrary, if the dung, when
voided, is hard, black, and offensive, or the parts
adhere to each other by a viscid ropy slime, they
are equal prognostics of internal heat, foulness,
and impending disquietude. Horses in this state
should be put under a course of physic without delay;
for till they are thoroughly cleansed, they
cannot with propriety be brought into any strong
exertions whatever. Another advantage is frequently
derived from an accurate inspection of the
dung, where <span class="smcap lowercase">WORMS</span> are sometimes seen in great
plenty, although, from the general appearance of
the horse, no such circumstance may have been
expected.</p>

<h3>DUNGANNON</h3><p>,—the name of a horse of much
celebrity, his winnings being equal to any racer of
his day. He was bred by <span class="smcap">Col. O'Kelly</span>, and
foaled in 1780. He was got by <i>Eclipse</i>; dam
(<i>Aspasia</i>) by <i>Herod</i>; her dam (<i>Doris</i>) by <i>Blank</i>;
grand-dam (<i>Helen</i>) by <i>Spectator</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c. After
beating every horse of eminence, particularly the
famous horse <i>Rockingham</i> over <span class="smcap">Newmarket</span>, he
was taken out of training, and as a stallion produced
annually some of the speediest and best bottomed
<span class="pagenum">{221}</span>
horses in the kingdom. He covered first at
twenty guineas, then at fifteen, and lastly at twelve.
He was sire of <i>Sybil</i>, <i>Cinderella</i>, <i>Equity</i>, <i>Lurcher</i>,

who ran and won without a name.</p>

<h3>EARS</h3><p>.—As the ears constitute much of the
beauty of a horse, according as they are <i>well</i> or <i>ill</i>
shaped, so from their situation, they are sure to
become early objects of observation. If they are
small, soft, and fine, curving inward in a small degree
at the point, perfectly erect, and spirited in action,
they give the animal a very noble, majestic,
and commanding aspect: on the contrary, when a
horse points his ears forwards, he bears the appearance
of looking eternally for <i>mischief</i>, and always
preparing to <i>start</i> at every object he meets, which
is no very pleasant sensation to the rider. Horses
of this description are seldom remarkable for the
<i>safety</i> of their <i>eyes</i>; a purchaser cannot be too circumspect
<span class="pagenum">{222}</span>
in his examination before he makes him
an acquisition. Horses having coarse, long, foul
ears, set on too low, and hanging down on the
sides, are called <i>mule</i> or <i>lop eared</i> horses; and if of
good form in other respects, and of some value,
they are in general cropped to improve their appearance.
The greater part of the racing stock of
old <i>Herod</i>, one of the best stallions ever bred in
England, were <i>foul</i>, <i>long</i>, and <i>wide</i> in their ears,
which is to be seen in almost the whole of their
progeny.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Pain</span> in the ear of a horse is discoverable immediately
by its flaccidity, and painful deprivation of
erection. The ear lays nearly flat either one way
or another; the horse is almost every minute giving
violent shakes of his head, which he as constantly
leaves hanging down on the side affected; from
which circumstances alone the seat of pain may
with certainty be ascertained. Pains in the ear
may arise from various causes, as colds, blows, the
insinuation of, or sting from, <i>forest flies</i>, <i>bees</i>, <i>wasps</i>,
or <i>hornets</i>. If the first is known to be the cause,
the stimulus excited by mildly rubbing the inside
with the half of a newly divided onion, will soon
relieve the pain. If from a blow, rubbing the ear
inside and out with two table-spoons full of camphorated
spirits, mixed with two tea-spoons full of
extract of saturn, will relieve. If from a sting, a
plentiful impregnation of fine olive oil, to give the
<span class="pagenum">{223}</span>
skin the power of expansion, will be right in the
moment of increasing inflammation; after which,
the swelling may be allayed with common white
wine vinegar, verjuice, or strong vegeto mineral
water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trimming</span> the
<span class="smcap lowercase">EARS</span> on the inside is a very common
practice, and adds considerably to the neatness
and cleanliness of the head and appearance; but
care should be taken never to let it be done during
rainy weather, sharp and severe winds, or in
the winter season; dreadful colds, as well as dangerous
diseases, have often been produced by these
means, without knowing from what cause the ill
effect has been derived. The operation of trimming
should be performed in warm, open, mild
weather, and with <span class="smcap lowercase">SCISSARS</span>
in preference to the
<i>flame</i> of a <i>candle</i>; which, with the additional use
of the <i>twitch</i>, only serves to put the poor animal to
a double degree of unnecessary misery. After the
ears are trimmed, they may be rubbed over the inside
with a small quantity of fresh butter, or a
piece of fine linen impregnated with olive oil, both
of which are excellent preventives to cold after
the operation.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>ECLIPSE</h3><p>—the name of the most famous horse
(since <i>Flying Childers</i>) ever produced or trained in
this or any other country. He was bred in Windsor
Great Park by the <i>Culloden</i> (or Great) <i>Duke of</i>
<span class="pagenum">{224}</span>
<i>Cumberland</i>, being foaled during the celebrated
eclipse in the year 1764, from which his name was
taken. He was got by <i>Old Marske</i>, dam (<i>Spilletta</i>)
by <i>Regulus</i>; her dam (<i>Mother Western</i>) by <i>Smith's</i>
son of <i>Snake</i>; grand-dam by <span class="smcap">Lord D'Arcy</span>'s <i>Old
Montague</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c. Upon the decease of his Royal
Highness, the stud were sold by auction at the Park
Lodge; where <i>Eclipse</i> (then a yearling) was purchased
by <span class="smcap">Mr. Wildman</span> for 46 guineas, and afterwards
sold to <span class="smcap">Colonel O'Kelly</span> (his last and only
possessor) for 1700 guineas. In 1769, when five
years old, he won two 50's at Epsom; 50 at <span class="smcap">Ascot Heath</span>;
the King's 100 guineas, and 50, at <span class="smcap">Winchester</span>;
the 100 guineas, the bowl, and 30 guineas,
at <span class="smcap">Salisbury</span>; and the King's 100 guineas at
<span class="smcap">Canterbury</span>,
<span class="smcap">Lewes</span>, and <span class="smcap">Litchfield</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>In 1770 he received forfeit 600 guineas, and won
the King's 100 guineas at <span class="smcap">Newmarket</span>; the King's
100 guineas at <span class="smcap">Guildford</span>;
the same at <span class="smcap">Nottingham</span>;
the same and 319 at <span class="smcap">York</span>; the King's 100
guineas at <span class="smcap">Lincoln</span>; 150 guineas, and the King's
100 guineas <i>again</i> at <span class="smcap">Newmarket</span>, where orders
having been privately given by his owner, "to go
off at <i>score</i>, and run the whole four miles for <i>speed</i>,"
he double distanced his opponents, and was then
taken out of training for want of a competitor.
From this time he continued as a stallion at Epsom,
in Surry, and afterwards at Cannons, the seat
of Colonel O'Kelly, in Middlesex, where he died
<span class="pagenum">{225}</span>
on the 27th of February, 1789, in the 26th year of
his age; leaving a progeny of winners and stallions
who are transmitting his blood to posterity in directions
too numerous to be obliterated to the end
of time.</p>

<p>He was sire of <i>Firetail</i>, <i>Soldier</i>, <i>Corporal</i>, <i>Serjeant</i>,
<i>Don Quixote</i>, <i>King Fergus</i>, <i>Nina</i>, <i>Charlemont</i>,
<i>Competitor</i>, <i>Gunpowder</i>, <i>Hidalgo</i>, <i>King Hermon</i>,

<h3>EARTH</h3><p>.—A fox beating his pursuers when
hunted, and taking refuge <i>under ground</i>, is then said
to have <i>earthed</i>, or gone to earth. Some of these
earths are situate in old chalk pits, forming such
different channels and ramifications amidst the roots
of trees in woods and coppices, that it is impossible
to dig them out; but where there is the least probability
of success, it is never relinquished; upon the
established and well-founded principle, that the
<span class="pagenum">{226}</span>
hounds are always <i>entitled to blood</i> after a
<span class="smcap lowercase">GOOD CHASE</span>.
A wanton and unnecessary destruction is,
however, at no time to be justified, particularly in
a country <i>thin</i> of <i>foxes</i>; such unthinking devastation
is frequently productive of a <i>blank</i> day at the end
of a season.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>EARTH-STOPPER</h3><p>—is an indispensible part
of a <span class="smcap lowercase">FOX-HUNTING</span> establishment, whose business is
principally performed by night. His department is
to visit and stop the strongest earths in the district
intended to be hunted on the following day. This
is usually effected between the hours of ten at night
and four in the morning, by means of <i>bushes</i>, <i>brambles</i>,
<i>earth</i>, &amp;c. to furnish which, he is provided
with a hand-bill, spade, candle and lanthorn, a hardy
rough poney, terriers, and of course <i>a pocket
pistol</i>, to recruit the spirits amidst the dreary scenes
it is become his occupation to explore. It is also
his business to <i>re-open</i> the <span class="smcap lowercase">EARTHS</span>

the day, that the <span class="smcap lowercase">FOXES</span> may not fall victims to
other modes of destruction.</p>

<h3>ELDER</h3><p>—is a tree common in most hedges in

from which people make a very good wine. It is,
however, only mentioned here to remind the reader,
that the <i>flowers</i> are a very excellent ingredient
in fomentations, and sporting gentlemen should

<span class="pagenum">{227}</span>
the heighth of the bloom, properly dried, and preserved

<h3>ELECAMPANE</h3><p>,—a root formerly in much
estimation for its efficacy in coughs and disorders of
the breast and lungs; hence the reputation it has
attained in pectoral compositions for the use of
horses. The great difficulty, however, of procuring
any thing like the <i>genuine root</i> in <i>powder</i>

any great gratification of expectation, to those who
rely too much upon the properties it is said to retain.</p>

<span class="smcap lowercase">SATURNINE</span> applications in a
liquid form; either as <i>corroborants</i>, <i>stimulants</i>, <i>repellents</i>,

<h3>EMOLLIENTS</h3><p>—are such external applications
as mollify the surface, and alleviate any stricture
upon the surrounding parts: they supple the
solids, as well as sheath and soften any asperity of

prove of the greatest utility in all tumefactions, enlargements,
and many lamenesses of <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSES</span>, with
those practitioners who have judgment and patience
<span class="pagenum">{228}</span>
to bring them perseveringly into use. From the
relaxing property of emollient topics, and their
sheathing of acrimony, it is that they are good sedative
applications, when pain from tension or irritation
is excited: from nervous sympathy, their
efficacy is conveyed to distant and deep-seated
parts, and thus it is that the warm bath proves in
most cases so powerful a sedative. <span class="smcap">Emollients</span>,
whether in the use of <i>fomentations</i>, or the application
of <i>poultices</i>, by relaxing the fibres, and increasing
the congestion of fluids, greatly promote
suppuration, to effect which in all inflammatory
tumours, they should be immediately brought into
use.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">ENTRANCE of HORSES</span></h3><p>—is the ceremony
of entering horses (at the particular places appointed)
on a certain day previous to the races at any
city, borough, or town, where the plates to be run
for are given and advertised. Horses intended to
run, are "to be <span class="smcap lowercase">SHEWN</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">ENTERED</span>," paying <i>two</i>
or <i>three</i> guineas "<i>entrance money</i>," (according to
the custom of the place,) and in general <i>five shillings</i>
to the <span class="smcap lowercase">CLERK</span> of <span class="smcap lowercase">THE COURSE</span>. For all plates
given by <span class="smcap">His Majesty</span>, or his R. H. the P. of <span class="smcap">Wales</span>,
no other entrance money is permitted, or paid, but
the before-mentioned fee to the clerk of the course.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3><span class="smcap">ENTRANCE of HOUNDS</span></h3><p>—is the introduction
of <i>young hounds</i> to the <span class="smcap lowercase">PACK</span>;
with whom, at a
<span class="pagenum">{229}</span>
proper age, they are incorporated, for their initiation
in the kind of chase to which they are then to
become appropriate. This is a matter so truly
professional, and so entirely dependent upon the
judgment of the <span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTSMAN</span>
and his <i>attendants</i>, that
neither instruction or entertainment can be derived
from literary description.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>EPILEPSY</h3><p>,—a disorder in horses, bearing some
similitude to <span class="smcap lowercase">APOPLEXY</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">STAGGERS</span>; for which
the same medical means are applied for relief.</p>

</div>

<h3>EQUERRY</h3><p>—is an appointment of much honour
in the home department of <span class="smcap">His Majesty</span>,
under the sole direction of the <span class="smcap lowercase">MASTER</span> of the <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSE</span>.
There are <span class="smcap lowercase">FIVE EQUERRIES</span> in this official situation,
one of whom is called the <i>first</i>: of the other four,
two are always in waiting to attend upon <span class="smcap">His Majesty</span>
in every equestrian excursion, whether
on the <i>road</i>, to the <i>field</i>, or in the <i>chase</i>, with whom
His Majesty most graciously condescends to converse
familiarly. His Royal Highness the <span class="smcap">Prince</span>
of <span class="smcap">Wales</span>, the <span class="smcap">Dukes</span> of <span class="smcap">York</span>, <span class="smcap">Gloucester</span>,
and other branches of the <span class="smcap">Royal Family</span>, have
likewise attendants of this description.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>EQUERRIES</h3><p>—apply equally to those in a
more subordinate situation, who personally officiate
in the <span class="smcap lowercase">STABLES</span> of the <span class="smcap">Crown</span>, and to whom is entrusted
the <i>breaking</i>, <i>managing</i>, and <i>preparing</i>
<span class="pagenum">{230}</span>
saddle-horses of every description for the <span class="smcap">King's</span>
use. Some of the out-riders who attend upon the
family, pass also under the same denomination.</p>

<h3>ESCAPE</h3><p>,—the name of a horse of great beauty,
excellent symmetry, and much celebrity. He
was bred by <span class="smcap">Mr. Franco</span>, and got by <i>Highflyer</i>
out of a <i>Squirrel</i> mare; he was foaled in 1785;
and in the First Spring Meeting at <span class="smcap">Newmarket</span>,
1789, he beat the <span class="smcap">Prince of Wales's</span> <i>Cantoo Baboo</i>,
from the ditch-in, for 200 guineas. He was
then purchased by his Royal Highness, and in the
Second Spring Meeting he received forfeit from
<i>Alexander</i>, and <i>Clown</i>, 100 guineas each. In the
First October Meeting of the same year, he beat
<i>Nimble</i> across the flat 200 guineas. The Craven
Meeting, 1790, he beat <i>Grey Diomed</i> over the
Beacon 500 guineas; and won the great subscription
purse at <span class="smcap">York</span>, beating <i>Actæon</i>, and <i>Gustavus</i>.
The Craven Meeting, 1791, he beat <i>Skylark</i>, <i>Highlander</i>,
<i>Glaucus</i>, <i>Halkin</i>, <i>Meteor</i>, and <i>Buffer</i>, a
subscription of 50 guineas each: two to one on
<i>Skylark</i>. First October Meeting the same year, he
beat <i>Grey Diomed</i> over the Beacon Course 8st. 7lb.
each for 1000 guineas. Two days after, he beat
him again for the renewed 140 guineas. In the
second October Meeting he won a subscription
purse (twelve subscribers) over the Beacon, beating
<i>Chanticleer</i>, <i>Skylark</i>, <i>Grey Diomed</i>, <i>Harpator</i>,
and <i>Alderman</i>, with the odds four and five to one
<span class="pagenum">{231}</span>
against him. When taken out of training, he covered
at Highflyer Hall at ten guineas a mare, and
half a guinea the groom.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>ESCHAR</h3><p>—is the prominence remaining upon
the cicatrix of an <i>ill-cured</i> wound, or the scab frequently
seen to form a projecting apex upon a
broken knee; or where some injury has been left to
cure itself by an effort of nature, without the least
interposition of art. If it is a scab only, and not
of long standing, it may in general be brought away
spontaneously, by occasional softenings with small
quantities of camphorated spermacæti liniment; if,
on the contrary, they are rigidly seated, and have
acquired a degree of callosity in the nature of a <i>sitfast</i>,
there is no other mode of cure, but by extirpation
with the knife and forceps.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3><span class="smcap">ESTRAY, or Stray</span></h3><p>,—appertain equally to
<i>horse</i>, <i>mare</i>, <i>bull</i>, <i>ox</i>, <i>cow</i>, <i>sheep</i>,
or, in fact, any
head of cattle, who having strayed from its own
home, common, waste, or lair, into a strange
<span class="smcap lowercase">MANOR</span>, or
<span class="smcap lowercase">LORDSHIP</span>, and there found without an
owner, is then called an <span class="smcap lowercase">ESTRAY</span>,
or <i>stray</i>: in which
case it is an established custom, sanctioned by
<span class="smcap lowercase">LAW</span>,
and founded in <span class="smcap lowercase">EQUITY</span>,
that such <i>stray</i> is proclaimed,
and his or her marks described, by the common
crier, in the three next nearest towns on the
market-day; and if the stray is not claimed within
a year and a day of the time on which it was publicly
<span class="pagenum">{232}</span>
cried, and fully described, it then becomes
the property of the <span class="smcap lowercase">LORD</span> of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">MANOR</span> where it
was found. If the owner makes the claim within
the time limited, he is liable to pay <i>reasonable
charges</i> for finding, keeping, proclaiming, &amp;c.
An estray must be kept without labour, uninjured,
and properly fed, till reclaimed, or the time above
mentioned is expired.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>EUPHORBIUM</h3><p>,—an article whose acrid and
stimulative property renders it only applicable to
one medical purpose, and that externally; it constitutes
a principal ingredient in the preparation of
<span class="smcap lowercase">BLISTERING OINTMENT</span> for
<span class="smcap lowercase">HORSES</span>, where its proportion,
if managed properly, should be exactly
equal with its corresponding article
<span class="smcap lowercase">CANTHARIDES</span>,
commonly called <i>Spanish flies</i>.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>EVACUANTS</h3><p>—are such medicines as gently
stimulate the intestines, and urinary passages, to a
more speedy secretion and expulsion of their excrementitious
contents. The term is applicable to
both <span class="smcap lowercase">PURGATIVES</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">DIURETICS</span>; the effect of
which is to remove plethora in horses, and to prevent
the consequent viscidity of blood; which,
when a horse is overloaded in his frame, and the
solids too grossly distended, soon displays itself in
<i>swelled legs</i>, <i>cracked heels</i>, cutaneous <i>scurfy eruptions</i>,
<i>grease</i>, <i>farcy</i>, or some <i>one</i> of the many ills
frequently produced by an accumulation of
<span class="smcap lowercase">HUMOURS</span>
<span class="pagenum">{233}</span>
originating in a corrupt or vitiated state of
the fluids, inconsiderately neglected, or probably
never attended to. Those who will condescend to
dedicate a little time occasionally to the palpable
utility of <span class="smcap lowercase">EVACUANTS</span>,
either as preventives, or the
means of cure, (in a variety of cases,) will never
stand in need of a monitor to promote their use.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>EVACUATION</h3><p>—is that part of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">ANIMAL ŒCONOMY</span>,
without a regular preservation of which,
the frame of man or beast cannot long continue
free from <span class="smcap lowercase">PAIN</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">DISEASE</span>. Next to the <i>aliment</i>
necessarily received for the support of life,
<span class="smcap lowercase">EVACUATION</span>
is the very effort of <span class="smcap">Nature</span> upon which
<span class="smcap lowercase">HEALTH</span> must principally depend.
Little penetration
is requisite to comprehend most perfectly a
system so plain as to require but very concise explanation.
Consistency should be observed, and
attention should be paid, to what the frame receives
by <span class="smcap lowercase">FOOD</span>,
and what it discharges by the different
<i>evacuations</i>; for if the body (within any
given time) accumulates much more by unreasonable
and unnecessary supplies, than the <span class="smcap lowercase">EFFORTS</span> of
<span class="smcap">Nature</span> can carry off by her different emunctories
in the <i>evacuation</i> of <i>excrements</i>, the foundation
of disease follows of course. The fluids become
thick and stagnant, the circulation languid, the
solids preternaturally distended, and their elasticity
partially destroyed; hence arises that infinite
number of distorted <span class="smcap lowercase">VALETUDINARIANS</span> with which
<span class="pagenum">{234}</span>
the streets of the <span class="smcap">Metropolis</span> so plentifully abound,
and by whom the constantly increasing <span class="smcap lowercase">MEDICAL SHOPS</span>
and <span class="smcap lowercase">MEDICINE WHAREHOUSES</span> are principally
supported.</p>

</div>

<p>By adverting to these considerations, it will
immediately appear, that even a temporary suppression
of the natural evacuations must, in the
first instance, inevitably prove the basis of <i>pain</i> or
<i>disquietude</i>, and lastly of <span class="smcap lowercase">DISEASE</span>. In the human
body, great attention should be paid to <i>diurnal</i>
evacuation, if a wish to preserve health is at all
entertained. Infinite are the miseries originally
brought on, and for years continued, (<i>to a lingering
death,</i>) by an inconsiderate neglect or indolence
in respect to the due proportion to be observed between
<i>repletion</i> and <i>evacuation</i>.</p>

<p>This attention is not more necessary in the human
frame, than it is with the <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSES</span> of those
who indulge the least desire to have their studs in
high health and perfect condition. When a horse
is observed to get above himself, or, in other words,
to become loaded with flesh, too full in the carcase,
round in the legs, thick in the wind, dull in the
stable, and heavy in action, <span class="smcap lowercase">EVACUATION</span> cannot
be too soon promoted as a preventive to impending
disease.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{235}</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>EXCRESCENCE</h3><p>.—Any preternatural enlargement
is so called; but it is principally, and most
properly, applied to those of a spongy nature, as
<span class="smcap lowercase">WARTS</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">WENS</span>, as well as a polypus upon any
particular part. In all <i>wounds</i> of
<span class="smcap lowercase">HORSES</span>, if they
are of considerable magnitude, fungous flesh increases
very rapidly, and frequently disconcerts the
young or injudicious <span class="smcap lowercase">VETERINARIAN</span>;
who, erroneously
adopting <i>caustics</i> and <i>escharotics</i>, too often
renders the remedy more destructive than the disease.
<span class="smcap">Fungous</span> formation of this kind passes also
under the technical denomination of
<span class="smcap lowercase">EXCRESCENCE</span>,
and is best reduced by superficial scarification in
lines transverse and longitudinal; the dressings then
consisting of strong red precipitate digestive ointment
with lint, &amp;c. Excrescences of the <i>warty</i>
kind will always submit to repeated and persevering
applications of <span class="smcap lowercase">BUTTER OF ANTIMONY</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">OIL OF VITRIOL</span>,
or any other escharotic, but they are not to
be laid on with too liberal a hand. Wenny deep-seated
substances (erroneously called excrescences)
require very warm stimulants, and powerful spirituous
applications, for a great length of time, before
any expectation of repulsion or obliteration
can be entertained.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>EXERCISE</h3><p>.—The great advantages resulting
from <span class="smcap lowercase">EXERCISE</span>, to both man and beast,
are now so universally understood, both in theory and practice,
that animadversion here must be considered
<span class="pagenum">{236}</span>
matter of superfluity: those, however, who wish
for a more enlarged or scientific disquisition, will
find <i>fifty pages</i> in the second volume of the
<span class="smcap">Gentleman's Stable Directory</span>
appropriated to this particular head.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>EXPEDIATE</h3><p>—is a term transmitted from one
book to another by former writers, but is at present
little used in either <span class="smcap lowercase">THEORY</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">PRACTICE</span>. It implies
the cutting out the centrical ball of the foot
of a dog, or such claws as shall totally prevent his
pursuit of game. In earlier times, when the
<span class="smcap lowercase">FOREST LAWS</span>
were more rigidly enforced, the owner of
any dog not expediated, living within the district,
was liable to a fine for non-obedience.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>EXTRAVASATION</h3><p>—applies only to such
fluids as may, from any accidental cause, or injury
sustained, escape from the tubes or vessels in which
they were confined; when they from such extravasation
become stagnant, laying the foundation of
an obstruction terminating in an enlargement, probably
disagreeable to the eye, and some impediment
to action. Extravasated lymph, oozing from ruptured
fibres, lay most invariably the foundation of
almost every tumefaction to which we can advert;
and evidently demonstrates the necessity for reflection
before we proceed <i>to blows</i>, when it is recollected
what serious and lasting injuries by blows
may be sustained.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{237}</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>EYES</h3><p>.—The state of the <span class="smcap lowercase">EYES</span>
in every horse
constitutes so much of the value and excellence in
respect to their <i>good</i> or <i>bad</i> formation, that proper,
nay extreme, circumspection ought to be used in
the examination previous to purchase. The best
and most experienced judges of horses are sometimes
seriously disappointed, and not unfrequently
deceived, in a superficial survey, and too hasty decision:
in fact, there is no <i>point</i> of the <span class="smcap lowercase">ANIMAL</span>
upon the merits of which (in a variety of instances)
it is so difficult to form an accurate, at least an <i>infallible</i>,
opinion as upon the parts before us. If
at first sight you are attracted by their bright, bold,
prominent appearance, and observe they are sufficiently
clear and transparent to reflect your own
figure in the eye as you stand before it, and the
horse neither <i>winks</i>, <i>blinks</i>, or rolls the orbs of the
eyes about, as if <i>feeling for the light</i> when brought
out of the stable, there is then every well-founded
reason to believe they are not only <i>safe</i>, but
<span class="smcap lowercase">PERFECTLY GOOD</span>.
On the contrary, when the <span class="smcap lowercase">EYE</span>
appears <i>flat</i>, as if sunk in its orbit, with a palpable
vacuum round the orb, between it and the eye-lid,
it is a very unfavourable indication; particularly if
there should be no defluxion (or inflammatory
discharge) from the eye, to justify the idea of a temporary
injury having been sustained by a <span class="smcap lowercase">BLOW</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">BITE</span>, or some such <i>accident</i>,
neither to be foreseen
or guarded against. If there is a palpable indentation
above the orbs, and a wrinkled contraction of
<span class="pagenum">{238}</span>
the eye-lids towards the forehead, they are invariable
symptoms, or certain signs, of impending danger,
and the subject cannot be ventured upon
without a very great probability of certain loss
when he is again offered for sale.</p>

</div>

<p>A small <i>pig-eye</i> should be likewise carefully
avoided, as they are seldom to be depended upon;
the subject is frequently addicted to <i>starting</i>, and
the future state of the eye in general <i>doubtful</i>. A
cloudy muddiness within the outer humour of the
eye, (giving it an opaque appearance,) or a milky
thickening of the surface, denote present <i>defect</i>,
and great probability of approaching <i>blindness</i>. It
becomes, therefore, in all cases of doubt, a matter
of self-preservation, to have in memory this admonition,
that it will be more advantageous (evidently
more prudent) to reject an object of impurity and
partial attraction, than to purchase in haste, and
"repent at leisure."</p>

<h3>FALLOW DEER</h3><p>—are the species of <i>Deer</i>
bred in parks for the production of venison, as
well for the private use of the great and opulent,
as for sale. The male is called <span class="smcap lowercase">A BUCK</span>;
the female,
a <span class="smcap lowercase">DOE</span>; the offspring of both,
<span class="smcap lowercase">A FAWN</span>; and they
vary some degrees in colour, but consist principally
of a dark dingy brown, inclining to black, or
a mottled sandy dun. The <span class="smcap lowercase">BUCK</span> is furnished with
horns, which he sheds yearly: the <span class="smcap lowercase">DOE</span>
has no such weapons for self-defence.</p>

</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap lowercase">BUCK</span> sheds his horns from the middle of
<i>April</i> through the first weeks of <i>May</i>, which are in
part regenerated by the month of <i>September</i>. The
<span class="smcap lowercase">DOE</span> generally produces her young
in the last week
of <i>May</i>, or during the two first of <i>June</i>. The
season for <span class="smcap lowercase">BUCK VENISON</span> commences
in <i>July</i>, and
goes out about Michaelmas; when <span class="smcap lowercase">DOE VENISON</span>
comes in, and continues till <i>January</i>. The time in
which the act of procreation is carried on (called
<i>rutting time</i>) commences at the latter end of <i>August</i>,
and continues during the greater part of <i>September</i>.</p>

<p>The skins of both buck and doe are manufactured
into the article of leather for breeches, so
<span class="pagenum">{240}</span>
superior to every other kind for the purpose of
riding, the produce of the whole kingdom is not
equal to the demand, many thousand skins being
annually imported from different parts of the
world. For the <span class="smcap lowercase">LAWS</span> relating to
<span class="smcap lowercase">DEER</span>, see
<span class="smcap">Deer Stealers</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buck hunting</span> was formerly a much more frequent
sport than at present; and a dwarf kind of
stag-hound (called <i>buck-hounds</i>) were kept for the
purpose. The uncertainty and short duration of
the chase, has, however, at length, nearly obliterated
the practice, as there is hardly such a thing
in the kingdom as <i>a pack</i> kept <i>solely</i> for the purpose
of hunting <span class="smcap lowercase">FALLOW DEER</span>.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>FALLOW LAND</h3><p>—is land so called when
under no immediate cultivation, but ploughed up,
and laid at rest, to acquire, from its exposure to
the elements, additional strength for the production
of future crops. Of these there are both <i>summer</i>
and <i>winter</i> fallows; upon the last of which, if dry,
<span class="smcap lowercase">HARES</span> may generally be found in the months of
<i>January</i>, <i>February</i>, and <i>March</i>, if there are any to
be seen in the country.</p>

<h3>FALCONER</h3><p>.—A <span class="smcap lowercase">FALCONER</span>,
whose province it was to <i>tame</i>, <i>manage</i>, and look after
<span class="smcap lowercase">FALCONS</span>,
and other <i>hawks</i>, was formerly as great and conspicuous
a character as the most celebrated <span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTSMAN</span>
<span class="pagenum">{241}</span>
of the present day. The influence of fashion,
and the changes wrought by time, have, however,
so obscured both <span class="smcap lowercase">SPORT</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">SPORTSMAN</span> in this way,
that neither <i>hawk</i>, <i>falcon</i>, or <i>falconer</i>, are to be
seen or heard of, unless in the northern parts of
the kingdom, where it is also nearly buried in oblivion.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>FALSE QUARTER</h3><p>—is a defect in the hoof
of a horse, originally sustained by some injury,
producing a destruction of parts; as <i>quittor</i>, <i>canker</i>,
<i>wounds</i>, <i>treads</i>, <i>bruises</i>, or such <i>formation of matter</i>,
by which a part of the hoof has been unavoidably
destroyed, or necessarily taken away. In
the regeneration of parts, the incarnation (from
the rigid and horny nature of the hoof) is irregular
and imperfect, forming a sort of <i>cleft</i> (or artificial
union) with the sound part upon the surface, productive
of a sensible weakness underneath. This
imperfect and defective junction renders such <i>quarter</i>,
as is it called, inadequate to the weight it is destined
to bear; in which case, much judgment is
required, and may be exerted, in the palliation, as
<i>perfect cure</i> is not to be expected. Care must be
taken in forming the shoe to relieve the tender part
from pressure, by <i>hollowing</i> it at that particular
spot, and letting the bearing be fixed entirely upon
the sound parts. By constant attention in reducing
the prominent edges of the irregular projection
with the fine side of the <span class="smcap lowercase">RASP</span>,
and a few occasional
<span class="pagenum">{242}</span>
impregnations with <i>fine spermacæti oil</i>, the hoof
may be sometimes restored to its original formation.</p>

<h3>FARCY</h3><p>,—except the <span class="smcap lowercase">GLANDERS</span>,
is the most unfortunate and destructive disease to which the
horse is subject. It is <i>infectious</i>, and may be communicated
from one horse to another, or to the
whole stable, where many stand together. As it
frequently attacks different subjects in a different
way, (according to the <i>state</i> and <i>condition</i> of the
horse at the time of attack,) so it has afforded opportunity
to the <i>fertile</i> and <i>ingenious</i> to extend and
define it to <i>various kinds</i> of <span class="smcap lowercase">FARCY</span>,
though they are but different shades and gradations of the same
disease.</p>

</div>

<p>The very first traits of this disorder are too
distinguishing to be mistaken; although the attack
may be made either <i>one</i> way or the <i>other</i>. The
subject is, in general, <i>dull</i>, <i>heavy</i>, <i>sluggish</i>, and
seemingly oppressed with <i>lassitude</i> and <i>debility</i>, for
some days previous to any external symptoms of
disease; in a short time after which, small <i>purulent
pustules</i> appear, with a sort of seeming <i>eschar</i> upon
the <i>apex</i> of each, running along the veins in a
kind of continuity, bearing no ill affinity or resemblance
to a bunch of grapes a little diversified
<span class="pagenum">{243}</span>
in size. Upon any of these <i>eschars</i>, or <i>scabs</i>, being
removed, they are followed by a thin bloody ichor
in some; but in others, by a fœtid, viscid, corrupted
matter, not unlike a mixture of honey and
oil, when brought into all possible incorporation.</p>

<p>As the disorder advances to a more inveterate
malignity, these pustules burst, the scab or eschar
exfoliates, and each becomes a virulent, ill-conditioned
<i>ulcer</i>. In many instances the progress is
extended with incredible rapidity; and the larger
vessels, with their inferior ramifications, are soon
universally affected; holding forth a very unpromising
prediction of early extrication. A tolerable
opinion may be formed of the mildness or threatened
severity of the disease by the nature of the
attack: if appearances are partial, (that is, attached
to any particular spot,) without a speedy
extension to different parts of the body, or its
extremities, the case may be considered in its then
<i>infantine state</i> favourable; and the proper means
should not be delayed to counteract its farther contamination
of the blood and juices: on the contrary,
should a daily increase of the eruption be
observed, spreading itself in various directions
along the plate-vein, and down the inside of the
fore-arm, under the belly, proceeding on both
sides the sheath, and down the inside of each thigh,
a cure may be considered very <i>distant</i> and <i>uncertain</i>;
involving a doubt for prudent deliberation,
<span class="pagenum">{244}</span>
whether the alternative of <span class="smcap lowercase">DEATH</span>
may not be preferable
to the <i>chance</i> of <i>cure</i>, at an expence (if
effected) very, very far exceeding the value of
<span class="smcap lowercase">THE HORSE</span>.</p>

<p>Experience, and attentive observation, tend to
justify an opinion, that when the <span class="smcap lowercase">FARCY</span>
makes its first appearance, in the way described, it is then of
the species received by <i>infection</i>, and that it has
lain dormant some time in the circulation. When
it makes its attack upon one particular part, in a
previous <i>tumefaction</i>, and subsequent <i>suppuration</i>,
(extending no farther than the quarter in which it
originates,) it may then be considered a degree of
the same disorder, retaining within itself much <i>less
virulence</i> than the former, and to have been produced
by the morbid state of the blood, and predominant
tendency to disease; holding forth a well-founded
prospect of <span class="smcap lowercase">CURE</span>, if the case happens to
fall into the hands of a judicious and scientific practitioner,
who well knows the peculiar <i>property</i> of
<i>medicine</i>, upon which alone the success depends.</p>

<p>Those writers who have industriously <i>divided</i>
and <i>sub-divided</i> the <span class="smcap lowercase">FARCY</span>
into so many <i>different diseases</i>,
have not noticed a disorder (or rather a complication)
partaking of the joint symptoms of both
<span class="smcap lowercase">GLANDERS</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">FARCY</span>; from which circumstance it
has, by the best and most experienced practitioners,
been denominated, <span class="smcap lowercase">FARCY GLANDERS</span>,
and is, in its <span class="pagenum">{245}</span>
attack, progress, and termination, precisely as follows.
One or more swellings appear upon some
part or parts of the body, where, after attaining a
certain size, they become <i>indurated</i>, making no farther
progress toward <i>maturation</i>. Here <span class="smcap lowercase">NATURE</span>
seems counteracted in her own efforts, and, by some
inexplicable <i>revulsion</i>, the head is almost immediately
and severely affected; <span class="smcap lowercase">TUMEFACTIONS</span> appear
under the <i>jaws</i>; the <span class="smcap lowercase">SWELLINGS</span>
increase in various
parts and degrees about the <i>eyes</i> and <i>mouth</i>; a most
incredible discharge comes on from the nostrils,
<i>discoloured</i> and <i>offensive</i> beyond description; in
which state, bidding defiance to every interposition
of <span class="smcap lowercase">ART</span>, or administration of
<span class="smcap lowercase">MEDICINE</span>, the animal
lingers a few days, and, if not previously dispatched,
(as in fact it ought to be,) <span class="smcap lowercase">DIES</span>
a <i>mass</i> of complete <i>putrefaction</i>.</p>

<h3>FARRIER</h3><p>—is the appellation by which a person
is known, whose occupation it has hitherto been
considered to execute the joint office of furnishing
<i>shoes</i> for the <span class="smcap lowercase">PROTECTION</span>
of the <span class="smcap lowercase">FEET</span>, and the
<span class="smcap lowercase">BODY</span> with
<span class="smcap lowercase">MEDICINE</span> for the <i>cure of disease</i>.
It has been, from its original formation as a business,
the most <i>dangerous</i>, <i>laborious</i>, and <i>least compensated</i>,
trade (or profession) of any in the kingdom;
consequently none but the most indigent or illiterate
(from the <i>eaves</i> of a <i>cottage</i>, or the <i>walls</i> of a
<i>workhouse</i>) could be prevailed upon to undertake
it. In proof of which, it is a well known fact,
<span class="pagenum">{246}</span>
that, for a century past, not more than <i>one</i> in
<span class="smcap lowercase">TWENTY</span> of its practitioners,
in either <i>town</i> or
<i>country</i>, has ever been enabled to leave a <i>clear
twenty pounds</i> to his family at the time of their decease.
Recent circumstances have, however, occurred,
to give the <span class="smcap lowercase">PRACTICE</span> of
<span class="smcap lowercase">FARRIERY</span> a new
complexion; but, unluckily, in the <i>extreme</i>; for
the appearance of "<span class="smcap">The Gentleman's Stable Directory</span>"
a few years since, and the success of
its author in his indefatigable endeavours, and
energetic exertions, to promote a reformation in
the shamefully neglected, <i>erroneous</i>, and <i>cruel</i> system
of <span class="smcap lowercase">FARRIERY</span>,
constituted such a blaze of national
emulation, that the institution, erection, and
establishment, of a <span class="smcap lowercase">PUBLIC SCHOOL</span>,
has rendered practitioners in <span class="smcap lowercase">FARRIERY</span>
(newly ycleped "<i>Veterinary
Surgeons</i>") as numerous as the necessitous medical
adventurers in almost every town and village
of the kingdom. See <span class="smcap">Veterinary College</span>.</p>

<h3>FARRIERY</h3><p>.—The <span class="smcap lowercase">ART</span> of
<span class="smcap lowercase">FARRIERY</span> consists
in the peculiar mode of discovering one disorder
from another, by a discrimination of predominant
symptoms, and the administration of medicine particularly
applicable to that peculiar species of
disease. It also comprehends and includes the
operations of <span class="smcap lowercase">BLEEDING</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">CROPPING</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">DOCKING</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">NICKING</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">BLISTERING</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">FIRING</span>, &amp;c. as well as the cure
of wounds, and the long train of <i>ills</i> and <i>accidents</i>
to which the horse is incident. This <span class="smcap lowercase">ART</span>
(or more <span class="pagenum">{247}</span>
properly <i>science</i>) now struggling to become respectable,
has hitherto continued in a state of the
most <i>wretched sterility</i> for the reasons so clearly explained
under the last head; to which may be
added, the very impressive consideration, that its
<span class="smcap lowercase">PROFESSORS</span> have not been permitted to retain the
least personal weight in the scale of society; on
the contrary, have been generally held in the most
trifling estimation, and consequently destined to
associate only with the <i>lowest</i> and least polished
classes of every description.</p>

</div>

<p>The degrading, dirty, and inferior offices to
which the <i>manual</i> or operative <span class="smcap lowercase">FARRIER</span>
must incessantly become liable in the course of his
<span class="smcap lowercase">PRACTICE</span>,
renders it readily to be believed, that those
whose <span class="smcap lowercase">EDUCATION</span> have been
sufficiently liberal to
qualify them for a scientific initiation in the
<span class="smcap lowercase">STUDY</span>
of <span class="smcap lowercase">PHYSIC</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">ANATOMY</span>, as well as a perfect knowledge
of the <span class="smcap lowercase">PROPERTY</span> of
<span class="smcap lowercase">MEDICINE</span>, cannot be
expected to descend to the <i>rough</i> and <i>laborious</i> business
of the <span class="smcap lowercase">FORGE</span>, making,
<i>fitting</i> and <i>setting</i> the
<span class="smcap lowercase">SHOES</span>, as well as many other
equally difficult and
hazardous operations to which the subordinate
must perpetually become subject in the course of
his practice. Hence it is fair to infer, that the
liberal education, and acquired polish, of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">VETERINARY SURGEON</span>,
will so ill accord with the
sensations of the <span class="smcap lowercase">SHOEING</span> or <i>black smith</i>, that they
will be found incompatible with <i>each other</i>; and,
<span class="pagenum">{248}</span>
until a more extended idea, and generous compensation,
is adopted by the public, to render the
<span class="smcap lowercase">MEDICAL MONITOR</span>,
(or veterinary surgeon,) and common
<i>shoeing-smith</i> and <i>operative farrier</i>, two distinct
and separate branches, the practice of <span class="smcap lowercase">FARRIERY</span>
and <span class="smcap lowercase">VETERINARY MEDICINE</span> will never attain
the improvement of which it is so clearly capable.</p>

<h3>FAWN</h3><p>—is the young of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">BUCK</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">DOE</span>,
called a fawn during the first year. A fawn is secreted
by the dam in the <i>fern</i>, or <i>long grass</i>, with
great care, during the first weeks, and seldom accompanies
the mother but by night. In royal
<span class="smcap lowercase">PARKS</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">CHACES</span>, a certain number are annually
killed when <i>fawns</i> of about three months old, to
prevent the district from being <i>overstocked</i>; this
is generally done by <span class="smcap lowercase">COURSING</span>
<i>with</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">GREYHOUNDS</span>,
which is most excellent sport, the greyhounds being
frequently <i>beat</i>.</p>

<h3>FEATHER</h3><p>.—The centrical division, and different
directions, of the surrounding hair in a
horse's forehead is so called: they are also frequently
seen upon the neck on one or both sides
the mane, and sometimes upon the hind quarters,
and are considered natural ornaments: their similitude
to a feather of the first plumage has given
them this appellation.</p>

<h3>FEATHER WEIGHT</h3><p>,—in the
<span class="smcap lowercase">SPORTING WORLD</span>,
signifies the lightest weight that can be
put upon the back of a <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSE</span>,
in whatever <span class="smcap lowercase">MATCH</span>
he may be engaged, and totally depends upon the
will of the owner; who is not under the necessity
of bringing his <span class="smcap lowercase">RIDER</span> to the
<i>scale</i> either <i>before</i> or
<i>after</i> the race, in an engagement where "feather
weight" is particularly expressed. On the contrary,
when a horse runs for any <span class="smcap lowercase">PLATE</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">MATCH</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">SWEEPSTAKES</span>, or
<span class="smcap lowercase">SUBSCRIPTION</span>, at a <i>fixed weight</i>,
according to his <span class="smcap lowercase">AGE</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">HEIGHTH</span>, or
<span class="smcap lowercase">QUALIFICATION</span>,
his <span class="smcap lowercase">RIDER</span> must be publicly weighed upon the
course <i>previous</i> to <i>starting</i>; and at the termination
of <i>every heat</i>, if the rider <i>dismounts</i> before his
horse is led up to the <span class="smcap lowercase">SCALES</span>,
(generally affixed to
the starting-post,) or when there, not weighing his
proper weight, the <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSE</span> is deemed
<i>distanced</i>, and
can start no more for the prize in question.</p>

<h3>FEEDER</h3><p>—is one essential part of a
<span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTING ESTABLISHMENT</span>,
bearing no ill affinity to the <i>bellows-blower</i>
of an <span class="smcap lowercase">ORGANIST</span>; for if the hounds
are not <i>well</i> and <i>properly</i> fed, they can never be
adequate to the fatigues and difficulties they have
to go through. To the <span class="smcap lowercase">FEEDER</span> is submitted the
management of the <span class="smcap lowercase">HOUNDS</span> in kennel; but he is
always subject to the occasional directions of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTSMAN</span>, whose immediate subordinate he is,
and whose dictation he must implicitly obey. He
should not only be <i>young</i>, <i>indefatigable</i>, and <i>alert</i>,
<span class="pagenum">{250}</span>
but fond of his employment; as well as <i>humane</i> and
<i>good tempered</i>, for the comfort of the poor animals
entrusted to his care, who have not the power to
expostulate when <i>ill used</i>, or to remonstrate if their
<i>grievances</i> stand in need of <i>redress</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>The department of the <span class="smcap lowercase">FEEDER</span> is of more
magnitude than may at first sight be believed. It
is his particular business to keep
<span class="smcap lowercase">THE KENNEL</span> <i>sweet</i>
and <i>clean</i>, and to execute this part of his trust at
stated and invariable periods. To <i>boil</i>, <i>prepare</i>,
and <i>mix</i> the different kinds of provision for the
<span class="smcap lowercase">HOUNDS</span>,
according to the regulations of the establishment
to which he belongs. When disengaged
from the concerns of the kennel, he is expected to
assist in <i>the stables</i>; as well as to <i>exercise</i> and <i>dress</i>
the spare horses of the <span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTSMAN</span>
and <span class="smcap lowercase">WHIPPER-IN</span>,
on hunting days when they are absent. In extensive
concerns, and large packs, two are required
to <span class="smcap lowercase">FEED</span>, in which case the
<span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTSMAN</span> (as is most
proper) always renders assistance.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>FEET</h3><p>.—The <span class="smcap lowercase">FEET</span> of
<span class="smcap lowercase">HORSES</span> being the very
basis of support upon which the safety and expedition
of the frame entirely depend, they are entitled
to every possible degree of <span class="smcap lowercase">CARE</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">ATTENTION</span>;
more particularly in the <span class="smcap lowercase">WINTER SEASON</span>,
when, from <i>neglect</i>, so many ills and inconveniencies
are known to arise. The injuries, accidents,
and diseases, to which the <span class="smcap lowercase">FEET</span> are constantly
<span class="pagenum">{251}</span>
liable, consist of <span class="smcap lowercase">CRACKS</span>
in the <i>heels</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">SCRATCHES</span> or
<i>lacerations</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">STUBS</span> and
<i>bruises</i> of the <i>outer sole</i>, or
upon the <i>verge</i> of the <i>coronet</i>, between <i>hair</i> and
<i>hoof</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">CORNS</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">SANDCRACKS</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">THRUSHES</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">CANKER</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">QUITTOR</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">RINGBONE</span>, and
<span class="smcap lowercase">FOOT-FOUNDER</span>; exclusive of
the frequent injuries sustained in <span class="smcap lowercase">SHOEING</span>,
by the <i>ignorance</i>, <i>indolence</i>, or <i>obstinacy</i> of those
<span class="smcap lowercase">SMITHS</span>
who, having no professional reputation to support,
are too innately confident in their <i>own ability</i> to bear
instruction.</p>

</div>

<p>As the <span class="smcap lowercase">DEFECTS</span>
thus enumerated will be found
individually enlarged upon under distinct and separate
heads, it becomes only necessary here to lay
down such general rules for the regular management
of the <span class="smcap lowercase">FEET</span>, as may (properly attended to)
prove the means of prudent prevention; not more
in respect to the <i>trouble</i> and <i>expence</i> of
<span class="smcap lowercase">DISEASE</span>,
than of the most mortifying and repentant anxiety.
These defects and disquietudes are seldom found
but in the stables where the <span class="smcap lowercase">MASTER</span>
rarely or ever
condescends to <i>obtrude</i> his <span class="smcap lowercase">PERSON</span>
and commands
upon the <i>tenacious dignity</i> of a self-important
groom; the persevering industry of whose careful
endeavours, and the pliability and elasticity of
whose joints, if properly exerted, would prove the
truest and most <i>infallible preventives</i> to
<span class="smcap lowercase">SWELLED LEGS</span>
and <span class="smcap lowercase">CRACKED HEELS</span>, in preference to all the
<i>nostrums</i> ever yet brought into private practice or
public use. And those who unfortunately encounter
<span class="pagenum">{252}</span>
<i>these ills</i>, may generally, and with justice,
attribute them much more to the <i>constitutional</i>
tardiness of the <i>professed groom</i> (or occasional
strapper) than any defect in the constitution of the
horse.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap lowercase">FEET</span> of different
<span class="smcap lowercase">HORSES</span> vary exceedingly
in what may be termed the <i>texture</i> or <i>property</i> of
the hoof; and this is, in general, regulated by the
colour of the <span class="smcap lowercase">LEGS</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">FEET</span>. There are few
horses with <i>white heels</i>, but what have <i>white hoofs</i>
also, and these are always more liable to, and susceptible
of, <span class="smcap lowercase">DEFECTS</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">WEAKNESS</span>, than those
of an opposite description. The sound, firm,
dark-coloured hoof, of the <span class="smcap lowercase">BAY</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">BROWN</span>, or
<span class="smcap lowercase">BLACK</span>
horse, is seldom found <i>defective</i>; but those of other
coloured horses are the most subject to weak, thin
soles, displaying a prominence on each side the
frog, occasioned by a too feeble and inadequate
resistance to the force of the membranous mass
within; feet of which description are also frequently
found to have the corresponding concomitant
of a <i>brittle hoof</i>, the edges of which are incessantly
<i>splitting</i>, and throwing out a constant
threatening of <span class="smcap lowercase">SANDCRACKS</span>,
with the additional mortification
of being subject to inveterate <span class="smcap lowercase">THRUSHES</span>,
or an almost constantly diseased or putrefied state
of the frog.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{253}</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Feet</span>, so exceedingly different in the nature
of their construction, must certainly require as
different a mode of treatment, according to such circumstances
as happen to exist. To preserve feet
perfectly sound, and free from the ills to which
they are subject, cleanliness is the leading step.
After exercise or use, so soon as the body is drest,
the <i>dirt</i> or <i>gravel</i> should be carefully taken from
under the shoes with a <span class="smcap lowercase">PICKER</span>,
the feet well washed,
the legs and heels rubbed dry, the bottom stopped
with <i>cow dung</i>, and the hoofs oiled with a brush
impregnated with <span class="smcap lowercase">SPERMA CÆTI OIL</span>. Horses left
with <i>wet legs</i> and <i>heels</i>, after a severe chace, or
long journey, particularly in sharp easterly winds,
or during <span class="smcap lowercase">FROST</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">SNOW</span>, constitute <i>cracks</i> or
<i>scratches</i> to a certainty. So severe a rigidity is occasioned
in the very texture of the integument,
that it becomes partially ruptured or broken in
various places, upon being brought into expeditious
action; which, with the <i>friction</i> and <i>irritation</i>
then occasioned by the sharp particles of gravel in
dirty roads, soon produce lacerations of the most
painful description.</p>

<p>The state of the <span class="smcap lowercase">SHOES</span>
should be constantly attended
to. Permitted to continue <i>too long</i> upon
the <span class="smcap lowercase">FEET</span>, the growth of the <i>hoof</i>
brings the shoe
forward, rendering it too short at the <i>heel</i>, when
it begins to indent, and <i>sinking</i> upon the <i>foot</i>, soon
presses upon the <i>outer sole</i>, constituting pain or disquietude
<span class="pagenum">{254}</span>
in some horses, and laying the foundation
of <span class="smcap lowercase">CORNS</span> in others. Horses, in moderate work,
require <span class="smcap lowercase">NEW SHOES</span> once a month upon an average,
never varying more than two or three days from
that time: indeed, it is not right they should go
longer. The penurious plan of <i>removing</i> shoes
<i>half worn</i> is truly ridiculous; they never render
service adequate to the expence, and the practice
only tends to a more frequent destruction of the
hoof. <span class="smcap">Thrushes</span> should be counteracted upon
their first appearance, without being permitted to
acquire a corroding virulence. <span class="smcap">Swelled Legs</span> are
hardly ever seen in stables where a proper course
of discipline, and regular routine of business, is observed;
they proceed from a visced, sizey state of
the blood, a languor in the circulation, a want of
exercise out of the stable, or a sufficiency of friction,
leg-rubbing, care, and attention within. See

<h3>FERN</h3><p>—is a plant abounding plentifully in
<span class="smcap lowercase">CHACES</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">BEECHEN WOODS</span>, and
<span class="smcap lowercase">COMMONS</span>, and is a
seeming diminutive resemblance of our native bulwark
the hardy oak, not more in the similitude of
its growth, than its appropriation to various purposes
of utility. It not only constitutes excellent
bedding for cattle in the winter, but has been considered
so instrumental to the <span class="smcap lowercase">PRESERVATION</span> of
<span class="smcap lowercase">GAME</span>, that laws have been
<i>framed</i> to prevent its
being wantonly destroyed, or unseasonably perverted,
<span class="pagenum">{255}</span>

</div>

<p>"Any person who shall unlawfully <i>set fire to</i>,

<h3>FERRET</h3><p>—is a useful little animal, well known
to <span class="smcap lowercase">WARRENERS</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">RAT-CATCHERS</span>, by whom they
are principally bred, as necessary to their own occupations.
The <i>ferret</i> is of great spirit, strength,
and courage, for its size; is an inveterate enemy
to <i>rabbits</i>, <i>rats</i>, and <i>poultry</i>; in the pursuit of
which, it will encounter any difficulty or danger,
when once put upon <i>the scent</i>. The body is longer
in proportion to its height, than almost any other
animal, the <i>weazel</i> and <i>stoat</i> excepted. The colour
<span class="pagenum">{256}</span>
frequently varies, even in the young of the
same dam and the same litter; some being black,
with white under the belly; some are of a faint
straw-colour yellow, and others of a light sandy
red. The head is, in its formation, not unlike <i>the
mouse</i>; the eyes are small, fiery, having the appearance
of red-hot iron, and can consequently
distinguish objects in the dark. It has a natural
and instinctive propensity to <i>burrowing</i>, and where-ever
<i>the head can enter</i>, the rest of the body can
easily follow. Whenever the <span class="smcap lowercase">FERRET</span>
has secured the prey he is in pursuit of, he extracts the <i>blood</i>
with extreme pleasure by <i>suction</i>, but is totally indifferent
to the <i>flesh</i>; with the exception of the
head of either <span class="smcap lowercase">RABBIT</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">RAT</span>, the skull of which
he directly destroys with his teeth, the better to
enjoy an instantaneous and luxurious <i>feast</i> upon
the <i>brains</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap lowercase">FERRET</span>
usually produces five or six young
at each litter, after a gestation of <i>forty days</i>: the
offspring continue blind for <i>thirty days</i>, and copulate
in six weeks after they can see. They are not
ravenous, (except in pursuit of their prey, after
having been long fasted;) are easily supported upon
bread, milk, and similar trifles, enabled by nature
to exist a long time without food, which is in some
degree compensated for by their great enjoyment
of sleep. When used in <span class="smcap lowercase">WARRENS</span>, they are hunted
with <i>muzzles</i>, that they may alarm the
<span class="smcap lowercase">RABBITS</span>,
<span class="pagenum">{257}</span>
and drive them from their <i>burrows</i> to the <i>nets</i>,
without having the power to injure them; for if
they were enabled to seize them <i>under ground</i>,
they could never be prevailed upon to leave the
earths.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>FETLOCK</h3><p>.—The part so called is the next
joint below the knee, and is formed by the union
of the shank-bone, at its <i>bottom</i>, with the upper part
of the small bone passing from this junction to the
coronary bone at its <i>top</i>. The <span class="smcap lowercase">TENDONS</span>
(commonly called the <i>back sinews</i>) have their lower seat
of insertion at this joint, which is constantly liable
to, and frequently susceptible of, the most serious
<span class="smcap lowercase">LAMENESS</span>. As injuries of this joint
are sometimes
incurable, particularly when occasioned by a twist
or ligamentary distortion, one precaution may be
prudently retained in memory; that more horses
are lamed by <i>short</i>, <i>sudden</i>, and <i>unnatural</i> turns in
the <i>narrow stalls</i> of an ill-constructed
<span class="smcap lowercase">STABLE</span>, (particularly
in the Metropolis,) than by any straitforward
means whatever. <span class="smcap">Tendinous lameness</span>
has a much greater chance of early relief, and permanent
cure, than an injury sustained at the <i>junction
of the bones</i>; for the relaxed tendons being restored
to their original elasticity by
<span class="smcap lowercase">CORROBORATIVE STIMULANTS</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">BLISTERING</span>, or
<span class="smcap lowercase">FIRING</span>, frequently continue
<i>sound</i> during the existence of the horse: on
the contrary, a <span class="smcap lowercase">LIGAMENTARY LAMENESS</span>,
however
<span class="pagenum">{258}</span>
it may be relieved, or <i>apparently</i> restored, is always
more subject to a relapse or repetition.</p>

<h3>FEVER</h3><p>,—<span class="smcap lowercase">HORSES</span>
are subject to, and frequently
attacked with, originating in various
causes, and acting upon different constitutions in
a different way. Judicious discrimination should
be made between what is (<i>ab origne</i>) a
<span class="smcap lowercase">FEVER</span>
within itself, and <i>symptomatic</i> fever, dependent
upon, and arising from, <i>another</i> cause. Extreme
pain may produce <span class="smcap lowercase">FEVER</span>,
as in large <i>formations</i> of
<i>matter</i>, where tumours approach gradually to suppuration.
<span class="smcap">Fever</span> may become attendant upon <i>inflammatory
cholic</i>, or upon a severe fit of the <i>strangury</i>,
or spasmodic affection of the kidnies. In all
<span class="smcap lowercase">INFLAMMATIONS</span> of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">LUNGS</span>, the fever exceeds description;
but these fevers are called <span class="smcap lowercase">SYMPTOMATIC</span>,
as being a concomitant, or distinguishing trait, of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">DISEASE</span> upon which it is <i>founded</i>,
rather than a disease within itself.</p>

</div>

<p>The predominant symptoms of <span class="smcap lowercase">FEVER</span>
are, an agitated lassitude and debility of the whole frame,
with evident disquietude in every position; quick
and strong pulsation; mouth parched and dry,
with a burning heat to the fingers, when placed
under the tongue; breath of a fleshy offensive
smell; the eyes red, inflamed and prominent, as
if propelled by internal inflammation; heaving
<span class="pagenum">{259}</span>
<i>more</i> or <i>less</i> in the flanks, according to the mildness
or severity of the case. Frequent attempts
are made to <span class="smcap lowercase">STALE</span>;
the urine is very <i>red</i> in colour,
and comes away in small quantities: the dung is
generally hard, voided in single or double globules,
to each of which adheres a <i>viscid slime</i>, indicative
of much internal foulness amidst the interstices of
the intestinal canal. Loss of appetite, difficulty of
respiration, a refusal of food, and impatient thirst
for water, are amongst the most invariable <i>diagnostics</i>
of <i>fever</i>; and as these symptoms are <i>more</i> or
<i>less</i> violent, may be estimated the severity and
<span class="smcap lowercase">DANGER</span> of
<span class="smcap lowercase">DISEASE</span>.</p>

<h3>FIDGET</h3><p>,—the name of a horse of much celebrity,
who won as many capital stakes as most
horses of his time. He was bred by <span class="smcap">Mr. Vernon</span>;
was got by <i>Florizel</i>; dam by <i>Matchem</i>, out of an
own sister to <i>Sweetbriar</i>. In the possession of the
<span class="smcap">Duke</span> of <span class="smcap">Bedford</span>,
he became a stallion at Wooburn,
and was the sire of <i>Augusta</i>, <i>Cub</i>, <i>Victor</i>,
<i>Frisky</i>, <i>Hamadryad</i>, <i>Nestler</i>, <i>Fantail</i>,
<i>Zemise</i>, <i>Granadilla</i>,
<i>Lady Sarah</i>, <i>St. Vitus</i>; all winners; as well
as a great number of colts and fillies, who won
large stakes at three and four years old, but ran
without a name.</p>

<h3>FIGGING</h3><p>—is the <i>sublime art</i> of insinuating a
profusion of false spirit, and <i>artificial fire</i>, into a
horse, when offering him for sale. This is done
<span class="pagenum">{260}</span>
by privately introducing a <i>piece</i> of <i>ginger</i> (previously
bitten) within the <i>sphincter</i> of the <i>anus</i>,
where, by its painful stimulus, it so irritates the
animal, that he seems, by the <i>cocking</i> of his tail,
the instantaneous erection of his ears, and the <i>deceptive
spirit</i> he displays in action, to be a horse of
very superior appearance and value to what he
turns out when the <i>stimulus</i> of this <i>deception</i> has

<h3>FIRING</h3><p>—is an operation performed upon different
parts of <span class="smcap lowercase">A HORSE</span> for the promotion of any
particular purpose, (according to the degree of injury
sustained,) and in the following way. The
horse being safely secured by <i>twitches</i> and <i>cords</i>,
according to the methods in general use, the
<span class="smcap lowercase">OPERATOR</span>
having his <i>irons</i> in the fire properly heated,
and his <i>attendant</i> ready to supply him with another,
as often as the <i>fire</i> of the previous <i>iron</i> is exhausted,
he proceeds with the edge of the <i>red-hot
iron</i> to make longitudinal and transverse strokes in
succession, over the whole part where injury has
been sustained, and to such extent as circumstances
may have rendered necessary; the depth and magnitude
of the <i>operation</i> depending upon the severity
of the injury, and the length of time since it was
sustained. <span class="smcap">Firing</span> is frequently adopted in <i>strains</i>
of the <i>back sinews</i>, where the subject is said to have

half an inch in thickness, becoming gradually
<i>thinner</i> towards the <i>edge</i>, which is not more than
<i>one third</i> what it is at the back. They are formed
of different dimensions for different occasions, and

the operation, where it is carefully and expertly
performed.</p>

conviction thereof, at the suit of the King, or the
party aggrieved, suffer imprisonment for the space
of three months, and find security for their good
behaviour.</p>

<p>By 22d and 23d Charles Second, c. xxv. s. 7,
it is enacted, That if <i>any person</i> shall, at <i>any time</i>,

<p><span class="smcap">Justices</span> are also authorized to <i>take</i>,
<i>cut</i> in <i>pieces</i>,
and <i>destroy</i>, all such articles as before recited and
adapted to the taking of fish, as may be found in
the possession of <span class="smcap lowercase">OFFENDERS</span> when taken.
Persons aggrieved may <i>appeal</i> to the
<span class="smcap lowercase">QUARTER SESSIONS</span>,
whose judgment shall be <i>final</i>. Although this
power is vested in a <span class="smcap lowercase">MAGISTRATE</span>,
yet the owner of
the <i>water</i>, or <i>fishery</i>, cannot justify such a measure,
but can only take them <i>damage feasant</i>, as is
particularly expressed in various clauses of different
acts of Parliament upon this subject. And by the
4th and 5th William and Mary, it is enacted,
That no person (except makers and sellers of nets,
owners of a river or fishery, authorized fishermen,
and their apprentices) shall <i>keep</i> any net, angle,
leap, pike, or other engine for taking of
<span class="smcap lowercase">FISH</span>.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{265}</div>

<p>The proprietor of any river or fishery, or persons
by them authorized, may seize, and keep to
his own use, any <i>engine</i> which shall be found in
the custody of any person fishing in any <i>river</i> or
<i>fishery</i>, without the
<span class="smcap lowercase">CONSENT</span> of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">OWNER</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">OCCUPIER</span>.
And such owner, occupier, or person,
authorized by <i>either</i>, sanctioned by the consent of
any <span class="smcap lowercase">JUSTICE</span>,
in the day-time, may search the
houses, or other places, of any person prohibited
to keep the same, who shall be suspected to have
such nets, or other engines, in his possession, and
the same to seize, and keep to their own use, or
<i>cut in pieces</i> and <i>destroy</i>.</p>

<p>By the 5th George Third, c. xiv. s. 1, it is
enacted, That if any person shall enter into any
<span class="smcap lowercase">PARK</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">PADDOCK</span> inclosed,
or enter into any <i>garden</i>,
<i>orchard</i>, or <i>yard</i>, belonging to, or adjoining

whatsoever, (without the consent of the owner,)
<i>steal</i>, <i>kill</i>, or <i>destroy</i>, any
<span class="smcap lowercase">FISH</span>, bred, kept, or
preserved therein, or shall be assisting therein, or
shall <i>receive</i> or <i>buy</i> any such fish, knowing them to
be such, shall, upon conviction, be <i>transported</i> for
<i>seven years</i>. Persons making <i>confession</i> of such offence,
and giving evidence against an accomplice,
who, in pursuance thereof, shall be convicted,
will be entitled to a free pardon.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{266}</div>

<p>And by the same Act, s. 3, it is enacted, That if
any person shall take, kill, or destroy, or <span class="smcap lowercase">ATTEMPT</span>
to take, kill, or destroy, any fish in any <i>river</i> or
<i>stream</i>, <i>pool</i>, <i>pond</i>, or <i>other water</i>, (not being in any
park or paddock enclosed, or in any garden, orchard,
or yard, belonging or adjoining to a dwelling-house,
but in any other enclosed ground, <i>being
private property</i>,) such person, being thereof convicted
by confession, or the oath of <i>one witness</i> before
a <span class="smcap lowercase">JUSTICE</span>, shall forfeit <i>five pounds</i> to the owner
of the fishery of such river or other water; and in
default thereof, shall be committed to the house of
correction for a time not exceeding <i>six months</i>.

<span class="smcap">Stealing fish</span> in <i>disguise</i> is made <span class="smcap lowercase">FELONY</span> by
the 9th George the First, c. xxii. If any person
<i>armed</i> and <i>disguised</i>, shall unlawfully <i>steal</i>, or <i>take

(whether armed or not) shall unlawfully and <i>maliciously</i>
break down the head or mound of any <span class="smcap lowercase">FISH-POND</span>,
whereby the fish shall be <i>lost</i> and <i>destroyed</i>,
or shall rescue any person in custody for any such

<h3>FISTULA</h3><p>.—Any ulcer having a <span class="smcap lowercase">SINUS</span>
or pipe
of uncertain termination, the inside of which has
acquired <i>callosity</i>, and from whence a matter or
bloody sanies flows, or may be pressed out, is
<span class="pagenum">{267}</span>
called a <span class="smcap lowercase">FISTULA</span>. In its more immediate
application, it appertains principally to the injury sustained
upon the <span class="smcap lowercase">WITHERS</span> of
<span class="smcap lowercase">HORSES</span>; <i>pinched</i> by the <i>saddle</i>,
or <i>bruised</i> by the <i>harness</i>; in long and severe
chases or journies with <i>one</i>, or long continued
weight and friction with the <i>other</i>. A repetition of
the <i>first cause</i> generally lays the foundation of
great trouble; some expence, and no small share
of anxiety: attended to upon the <i>first injury</i>, the
inflammation frequently submits (and <i>sometimes
speedily</i>) to the mildest class of
<span class="smcap lowercase">REPELLENTS</span>: a fomentation
of hot vinegar <i>twice</i> or <i>thrice</i>, for ten
minutes each time, or a few applications of strong
<span class="smcap lowercase">VEGETO MINERAL</span>,
incorporated with a proportion
of camphorated spirits, will generally prevent any
farther cause of disquietude.</p>

</div>

<p>There is no one <i>disease</i>, or <i>injury</i>, to which
<span class="smcap lowercase">THE HORSE</span>
is incident, more perplexing to the <span class="smcap lowercase">VULCANIANS</span>
of the <i>old school</i> or <span class="smcap lowercase">VETERINARIANS</span> of the
<i>new</i>, than a <span class="smcap lowercase">FISTULA</span>;
the formation and process
of which is precisely thus. A repetition of the
bruise and friction, or painful pressure upon the
wither, having excited inflammation, <span class="smcap lowercase">NATURE</span>
makes an <i>effort</i> in her <i>own</i> favour; tumefaction or
swelling ensues, and suppuration follows of course.
From the bony structure of this particular part, a
copious secretion of matter is in the first instance
never obtained, or, indeed, to be expected. From
the great difficulty of securing poultices so as to retain
<span class="pagenum">{268}</span>
their situation, the <span class="smcap">progress</span> of
<span class="smcap">maturation</span>
is always tardy, and ultimately both <i>partial</i> and
imperfect: the aperture, if <i>self-made</i>, is always
exceedingly small, from which may be immediately
traced with the probe, <i>one</i> or <i>more</i> pipes or
<span class="smcap lowercase">SINUSSES</span>
in different directions, becoming more and more
<i>callous internally</i>, according to the length of their
standing, or the injudicious mode in which they
may have been treated.</p>

<p>Various modes of treatment, and different directions
for a certainty of cure, have been laid
down by successive writers upon <span class="smcap lowercase">FARRIERY</span>, and
frequently with <i>little</i> success. <span class="smcap">Theory</span>,
it must be admitted, is <i>one</i> thing; the execution in
<span class="smcap lowercase">PRACTICE</span>
is <i>another</i>. The <span class="smcap lowercase">VOLUME</span> of
<span class="smcap lowercase">EXPERIENCE</span> opens to
the mind of rumination, and professional emulation,
a <i>new page</i> every day; that page now demonstrates
the <i>fact</i>, that the most inveterate and
long-standing <span class="smcap lowercase">FISTULA</span> is to be firmly
and infallibly cured, and the parts perfectly restored, by a mode
easy in execution, and invariable in effect. Let a
silver probe be passed in every possible direction,
that the <span class="smcap lowercase">SINUSSES</span> may be precisely ascertained;
this done, let the probe be properly <i>armed</i> with
<i>lint</i>, then plentifully impregnated with <span class="smcap lowercase">BUTTER</span> of
<span class="smcap lowercase">ANTIMONY</span>, and carefully introduced in such state
into <i>each distinct sinus</i>, (whichever way they divide
or ramify;) when there, give the probe a turn, that
every part may be equally affected; artificial inflammation
<span class="pagenum">{269}</span>
will succeed, the internal <span class="smcap lowercase">CALLOSITY</span>
will be <i>destroyed</i>, and slough off in a few days from
the sound parts. The <i>vacuum</i> may then be cleansed
with equal parts of <span class="smcap lowercase">FRIAR'S BALSAM</span>, and
<span class="smcap lowercase">TINCTURE</span>
of <span class="smcap lowercase">MYRRH</span>, by a long-necked syringe,
once in three or four days; and the <span class="smcap lowercase">WOUND</span>
being daily dressed
with the <i>precipitate digestive ointment</i>, insinuated
with <i>lint</i> rolled round the <i>probe</i>, and when properly
inserted, slipt off with the force of the finger
and thumb into the wound, and covered with a
sticking plaister to keep it firm, incarnation will
be gradually promoted, and <span class="smcap lowercase">COMPLETE CURE</span>
certainly follow.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">FLANK of a HORSE</span></h3><p>—is the part lying between

<span class="smcap lowercase">HIND QUARTER</span>, reaching
from the part of the <span class="smcap lowercase">LOINS</span>
nearest the <i>hip-bone</i>, to
the bottom of the belly nearest the <span class="smcap lowercase">STIFLE</span>. If a
horse is well ribbed up, his flank not <i>hollow</i>, but
circularly prominent, and his <span class="smcap lowercase">BACK SHORT</span>, he is
then called a "good barrelled horse," and is very

<h3>FLESHY-FOOTED</h3><p>.—A horse is said to be
<span class="smcap lowercase">FLESHY FOOTED</span>,
when that part of the <i>bottom of the
foot</i> on each side the <span class="smcap lowercase">FROG</span>
(called the <span class="smcap lowercase">OUTER SOLE</span>)
is preternaturally prominent, constituting a convexity
above the <i>wall</i> or <i>crust</i> of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">HOOF</span>, where
the shoe should have its proper bearing upon the
<span class="smcap lowercase">FOOT</span> of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">HORSE</span>. In feet of this description,
the outer sole, from repeated bruising and battering
in constant work upon hard roads, or from an
injudicious and destructive <i>paring away</i> with the
butteris, are so exceeding thin as to indent with
the slightest impression, and being too weak to resist
the membranous expansion within, compulsively
submit to the internal propulsion, and are thrown
into the projecting form already described. Great
care is required in shoeing horses with this defect:
the inner part of the web of the shoe should be so
completely hollowed as not to admit the least
chance of bearing upon the prominent part; if it
does, tenderness and disquietude (if not lameness)
must inevitably ensue. In cases of this kind, neither
the <i>butteris</i> or <i>drawing-knife</i>, should be permitted
in hand; they only render the <span class="smcap lowercase">REMEDY</span>
worse than the <span class="smcap lowercase">DISEASE</span>.</p>

<span class="smcap lowercase">FLESH</span>, and not very <i>foul</i> in <i>condition</i>.
On the contrary, those who are advocates
for the <span class="smcap lowercase">STRAW-YARDS</span>
within <i>ten</i> or <i>fifteen</i> miles of
<span class="pagenum">{272}</span>
the <span class="smcap">Metropolis</span>, had better <i>cut the throats</i> of their
<span class="smcap lowercase">HORSES</span> than make the experiment: they barely exist
in a state of wretched starvation, are brought up in
the months of April and May objects of dreadful
emaciation, and commonly occasion more expence
to generate flesh, and render them fit for use, than
they are afterwards worth. An insufficiency of
sweet, good, and healthy <span class="smcap lowercase">FODDER</span>, or even a profusion
of <i>stinking oats</i>, or <i>musty hay</i>, will inevitably
impoverish the blood, and lay the foundation of

<span class="smcap lowercase">FARCY</span>, and other disorders.</p>

<h3>FOIL</h3><p>,—a term used in
<span class="smcap lowercase">HARE HUNTING</span>. When,
during the chase, a hare, after a <i>head</i> or <i>double</i>,
runs over the ground she has <i>ran before</i>, she is then
said to be <i>running the foil</i>, and with strict truth,
for nothing can so much <i>foil</i> the
<span class="smcap lowercase">HOUNDS</span> as a chase
of this description. <span class="smcap">Old hares</span>, who have speed
enough to break away, and get considerably a-head,
almost invariably throw themselves out to the <i>right</i>
or <i>left</i>, <i>double</i>, and <span class="smcap lowercase">QUAT</span>;
particularly if a <i>hedge-row</i>,
<i>hedge</i>, <i>fern</i>, <i>furze</i>, or any <i>kind of covert</i>
presents itself favourably for the purpose. The
<span class="smcap lowercase">HOUNDS</span> continuing to run the scent to the spot
where she made her head, <i>over-run the hare</i>, and
having no continuance of scent, are of course <i>at
fault</i>; during which delay of <i>trying forward</i>, <i>trying
back</i>, making a cast to <i>the right</i>, then a cast to <i>the
left</i>, the <span class="smcap lowercase">HARE</span>
slips into her <i>foil</i>; by repeatedly
running of which with the same instinctive sagacity,
<span class="pagenum">{273}</span>
she as repeatedly saves her life; without which,
and many similar <i>innate shifts</i> to avoid their numerous
enemies, there would not long be a <span class="smcap lowercase">HARE</span>
left in the country.</p>

<h3>FOMENTATION</h3><p>—is, perhaps, the most generally
useful of all external applications in a great
variety of cases, and cannot of course be too well
known, or too much encouraged. It is a process
but little <i>prescribed</i> or <i>practised</i> by
<span class="smcap lowercase">FARRIERS</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">VETERINARIANS</span>;
either because its efficacious property
is very little known; or the persevering patience
required in the act, is too great for <i>constitutional
indolence</i>. In all inflammatory <i>tumours</i> and
<i>enlargements</i> arising from
<span class="smcap lowercase">STRAINS</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">BLOWS</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">BRUISES</span>,
and various other injuries, the efficacy of hot and
persevering <span class="smcap lowercase">FOMENTATION</span> can only be known to
those who have repeatedly experienced its salutary
effects. In fact, its properties are <i>twofold</i>, in as
much as it assists <span class="smcap lowercase">NATURE</span> in whichever is her most
predominant effort, either for <i>absorption</i> or <i>suppuration</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fomentations</span> are prepared by boiling three or
four double handsful of the different kinds of <i>aromatic</i>
garden herbs in <i>six quarts</i> or <i>two gallons</i> of
water, occasionally stirring them for a quarter of an
hour; then let the part affected be patiently
<span class="smcap lowercase">FOMENTED</span>
<span class="pagenum">{274}</span>
with <i>sponges</i> or <i>flannels</i>, alternately dipped
in the <span class="smcap lowercase">DECOCTION</span>, as hot as it can be consistently
used without <i>injury</i> to the <i>hair</i>.
If the <span class="smcap lowercase">TUMOUR</span>,
or enlargement, does not threaten <i>suppuration</i>, the
absorption may be assisted by a gentle persevering
friction in <i>hand-rubbing</i>, previous to the application
of such <span class="smcap lowercase">REPELLENT</span>
as may be thought applicable to
the case: on the contrary, should a formation of
matter have evidently taken place, the intention of
nature cannot be too expeditiously promoted; an
<span class="smcap lowercase">EMOLLIENT POULTICE</span> should
<i>instantly</i> follow the
<span class="smcap lowercase">FOMENTATION</span>, and both be repeated
<i>once</i> or <i>twice</i>
a-day, according to the magnitude of the emergency.</p>

<p>The herbs chiefly in use for <span class="smcap lowercase">FOMENTATIONS</span> (and
from which any three or four may be selected) are
<span class="smcap">Roman</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">COMMON WORMWOOD</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">MALLOWS</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">MARSHMALLOWS</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">LAVENDER</span> leaves and flowers,
<span class="smcap">Rosemary</span> leaves,
<span class="smcap lowercase">CAMMOMILE</span> flowers,
<span class="smcap">Elder</span>
flowers, and <span class="smcap">Bay</span> leaves. These are articles not
always to be readily obtained; and as they are in
all <span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTING</span> establishments likely to be wanted upon
the most sudden emergencies, <span class="smcap lowercase">GENTLEMEN</span> in the
country will find the convenience of giving orders
for an <i>annual</i> supply to be provided, and properly
dried, in the summer, that no disappointment may
be experienced in the winter, when their use is
more likely to be required. They are kept ready
mixed at the <span class="smcap lowercase">BOTANICAL SHOPS</span>
in the <i>different markets</i>
<span class="pagenum">{275}</span>
of the Metropolis, and may always be had in
any quantity under the denomination of

<h3>FOOT</h3><p>.—The foot of a horse extends from the
<span class="smcap lowercase">FETLOCK-JOINT</span> to the
<span class="smcap lowercase">OUTER SOLE</span> at the bottom of
the <i>hoof</i>: it includes the
<span class="smcap lowercase">CORONARY-BONE</span>, the
<span class="smcap lowercase">NUT-BONE</span>, the
<span class="smcap lowercase">COFFIN-BONE</span>, and the inner sole,
(or membranous mass,) in which it is deposited; as
well as the <i>frog</i> and the <i>wall</i> or <i>hoof</i> surrounding
and supporting the whole.—See <span class="smcap">Feet</span>.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>FOOT-FOUNDERED</h3><p>.—A horse is said to be
<span class="smcap lowercase">FOOT-FOUNDEREd</span> when there is an evident defect
in action, and a palpable tenderness, which prevents
him from putting his feet <i>freely</i> and <i>boldly</i> to
the ground. This malady seems never to have
been clearly comprehended, or perfectly explained,
by any of those who have written upon the subjects
included in the general practice of
<span class="smcap lowercase">FARRIERY</span>. It is
to be observed, that <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSES</span>
labouring under this <i>infirmity</i>,
have become gradually <i>contracted</i> in the
<i>hoof</i>, and proportionally <i>narrowed</i> at the <i>heels</i>, putting
their feet before each other with as much fear
and caution, as if they were moving upon a <i>sheet of
red-hot iron</i>; the <span class="smcap lowercase">RIDER</span>
of any such horse, being
constantly in the <i>happy</i> expectation of the horse's
<i>pitching</i> upon his <i>head</i>, and probably breaking the
rider's own neck.</p>

</div>

<div class="pagenum">{276}</div>

<p>The very few reasons hitherto assigned for the
origin of this defect, "as being watered when <i>too
hot</i>, then setting the horse upon <i>cold</i> planks without
<i>litter</i>;" "heats and colds, which disorder the body,
and excite malignant humours, that inflame the
blood, melt the grease, and make it descend downward
to the feet, where it settles, and causes a
numbness in the hoofs;" are so truly nugatory,
that they are not for a single moment entitled to
<span class="smcap lowercase">SCIENTIFIC</span> disquisition.
The only two <span class="smcap lowercase">RATIONAL CAUSES</span>
which can be assigned for this disorder (if it
can with propriety be so termed) seem never to have
attracted professional observation or reflection.
That it has its foundation in <i>long</i> and <i>hard</i> riding
(or drawing) upon the <i>hard</i> and <i>hot</i> roads in the
summer months, will not admit of a single doubt;
which foundation once laid, is not only increased
by every <i>repetition</i> of the original cause, but a
formidable addition made to it by the <i>shameful</i> and
<i>destructive</i> practice of fitting <i>red-hot shoes</i>,
from <span class="smcap lowercase">THE FORGE</span>,
to the <i>foot</i> of <i>the horse</i>; an unrelenting act of
cruelty, constantly and obstinately persevered in at
almost every <i>shoeing-shop</i> in the kingdom, by which
infernal act alone, <i>hundreds</i> of horses are annually
<span class="smcap lowercase">FOOT-FOUNDERED</span>;
to crush which evil, <span class="smcap lowercase">THE LEGISLATURE</span>
would not find itself <i>degraded</i>, by enacting
a prohibitory <span class="smcap lowercase">LAW</span>,
any more than by <i>condescending</i>
to protect the persons of the outside passengers
upon a <span class="smcap lowercase">STAGE COACH</span>.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{277}</div>

<p>To justify what is advanced upon the subject of
<span class="smcap lowercase">FOOT-FOUNDER</span>,
let it be recollected, that persevering
<i>friction</i> will produce <i>fire</i>; of which we have
repeated proofs in the number of carriages known
to have taken fire upon the roads, and to have been
totally consumed. We are convinced a piece of
<i>cold iron</i>, struck with a hammer five or six times in
succession upon an anvil, will quickly afford a
communication of <i>fire</i> to a <i>match</i>; this being reduced
to an incontrovertible certainty, what must
be the excess of <i>heat</i> produced by the
<span class="smcap lowercase">EFFECT</span> of
<span class="smcap lowercase">ATTRITION</span> between the
<i>shoe</i> of <i>a horse</i> and the
<i>hardness</i> of the <i>road</i> in the summer months, the
animal going a <span class="smcap lowercase">FIFTEEN</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">TWENTY</span> miles stage, at
the rate of <i>twelve</i> or <i>fourteen</i> miles an hour?</p>

<p>Why, the effect is precisely this; that, by the
time the horse has travelled a <i>few miles</i>,
the <span class="smcap lowercase">RIDER</span>
dismounting, will find, upon <i>instantaneous</i> examination,
the shoe has acquired (by the attrition already
described) a <i>degree</i> of <i>heat</i> beyond his power to bear
with his hand, without being seriously burned.
The effect of heat <i>without</i>, being the same <i>within</i>,
acts so powerfully (in proportion to the continuation
of the journey, and the state of the road) upon
the foot of the horse, particularly those of the
weakest texture, and the most susceptible, that the
<span class="smcap lowercase">INNER SOLE</span>
(or membranous mass in which the
<i>coffin-bone</i> is lodged) becomes <i>in time</i>, and by <i>repetition</i>,
partially divested of its moisture, the very
<span class="pagenum">{278}</span>
source of sensation; upon which contraction of the
<i>internal</i> parts, the <span class="smcap lowercase">HOOF</span>
losing its means and support
of <i>expansion</i>, contracts in a corresponding degree,
constituting the <i>impoverished appearance</i>,
<i>brittle-hoof</i>, and <i>narrow heel</i>, previously described.</p>

<p>Those who have been so exceedingly sparing, or
so accidentally <i>sterile</i>, in respect to the <i>causes</i> of this
<span class="smcap lowercase">DEFECT</span>, have, nevertheless,
been sufficiently liberal
in directing <span class="smcap lowercase">A CURE</span>.
"First, pare all the horse's
soles so thin that you may see the quick; then
bleed him well at every toe; after which stop the
vein with tallow and resin melted together; and
having tacked some hollow shoes slightly on his
feet, stop them with bran, tar, and tallow, melted
together, and poured into the feet as hot as can well
be born; repeat this every other day for a week or
nine days, after which give him proper exercise
daily; or, what is still better, turn him out for six
weeks, if it is a proper season for so doing."</p>

<p>Whether this mode, so strenuously recommended,
and copied by <i>one</i> writer from <i>another</i>, is
likely to effect a cure, every reader will enjoy the
privilege of judging for himself: it is, however,
most likely that those who rely upon any professional
exertions for total obliteration, will be disappointed,
and that occasional palliation is all that
can be reasonably expected. There is, however,
no doubt, but frequent and plentiful impregnations
<span class="pagenum">{279}</span>
of the <i>whole hoof</i>, and <i>bottom</i> of the <i>foot</i>, with
<span class="smcap lowercase">SPERMA CÆTI OIL</span>, made warm over the fire, will
contribute as much to the expansion of the hoof,
and the regeneration of membranous moisture in
its contents, as any other means whatever.</p>

<h3>FOREHAND</h3><p>—implies that part of
<span class="smcap lowercase">A HORSE</span>
extending from the <i>ears</i> to the <i>withers</i>; which, to
be handsome, should be long, and rise gradually
from the upper point of the shoulder-blade to the
very extremity of the ear. A <span class="smcap lowercase">FOREHAND</span> of this
description adds greatly to the majestic appearance
and value of the horse. But a horse <i>low before</i>,
with a <i>short forehand</i>, and <i>indented crest</i>, can never
become an object of attraction.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>FOREHEAD</h3><p>.—The forehead is the front of
the horse's head; to observe the <i>form</i> and <i>effect</i> of
which, it will be necessary to get before him. It
is the space extending from the <i>roots</i> of the <i>ears</i>,
and between the eyes, which being <span class="smcap lowercase">BROAD</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">FLAT</span>, having a <i>feather</i> or
<i>star</i> in the center, constitutes
a degree of beauty, and may be supposed
to have a cross of <span class="smcap">the Arabian</span> in the blood. If
a horse, having a wide flat forehead, has the advantage
of a full prominent spirited eye, they at
the first approach afford no small indication of excellence;
and, upon nearer inspection, a corresponding
symmetry is expected to follow.</p>

<h3>FORE-LEGS</h3><p>.—The fore-legs of a horse begin
at the lower extremity of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">SHOULDER-BLADE</span> before,
and the <span class="smcap lowercase">ELBOW</span> behind: they consist of what
are termed the <span class="smcap lowercase">ARMS</span>,
(or fore thighs,) which extend
to each <span class="smcap lowercase">KNEE</span>;
the <i>shank-bone</i> from the knee
to the <span class="smcap lowercase">FETLOCK JOINT</span>;
the fetlock-bone is continued
from thence to the <span class="smcap lowercase">CORONARY-BONE</span>, into
which it is <i>inserted</i>; the coronary-bone in part fills
the cavity, or box of the hoof, being lodged in the
<span class="smcap lowercase">COFFIN-BONE</span>,
supported by the <i>nut-bone</i> behind;
these last are deposited in the membranous mass
denominated the <span class="smcap lowercase">INNER SOLE</span>;
the whole being
terminated by the bottom of the <i>hoof</i>, the <i>frog</i>, and
the <i>outer sole</i>. The <span class="smcap lowercase">FORE-LEGS</span>,
to be uniform,
(in a front view,) should be <i>wide</i> at the upper part
next the <i>breast</i>, strong and broad in the
<span class="smcap lowercase">ARM</span>, bony
below the <span class="smcap lowercase">KNEE</span>,
free from <span class="smcap lowercase">SPLENTS</span>, a broad sound
<span class="smcap lowercase">HOOF</span>,
firm <span class="smcap lowercase">SOLE</span>, and a

<h3>FOREST</h3><p>.—A <span class="smcap lowercase">FOREST</span>
is a large tract of land in
pasture, many miles in extent and circumference,
the property of <span class="smcap lowercase">THE CROWN</span>,
mostly well stocked
with timber, (from whence the navy is supplied,) as
well as with a variety of <i>underwood</i>, <i>furze</i>, <i>fern</i>, &amp;c.
for the breeding and preservation of both
<span class="smcap lowercase">VENISON</span>
and <span class="smcap lowercase">GAME</span>.
Forests are of great antiquity, and
their immunities are protected by laws peculiarly
and solely adapted to their preservation; the execution
of which are lodged in principal officers,
and their subordinates, as follows;

<p>A <span class="smcap lowercase">FOREST</span>
has its foundation under a commission
bearing the great seal of England, and when proclaimed
through the county in which the land so
appropriated lies, "that it is
<span class="smcap lowercase">A FOREST</span>, and to be
governed by the <span class="smcap lowercase">LAWS OF A FOREST</span>,"
it then becomes
a forest upon <i>record</i>, and the
<span class="smcap lowercase">OFFICERS</span> before
mentioned are appointed. A forest has its
"<span class="smcap lowercase">BOUNDARIES</span>,"
its "<span class="smcap lowercase">PURLIEUS</span>,"
its "<span class="smcap lowercase">PROPERTIES</span>,"
its "<span class="smcap lowercase">COURTS</span>,"
with a variety of regulations equally
uninteresting and unentertaining, except to those
who are resident within its precincts; to whom a
variety of enlarged particulars will be useful, and
may be found in "<span class="smcap">Daniels' Rural Sports</span>," a
recent publication of merit and celebrity.</p>

<p>There are said to have been <span class="smcap lowercase">SIXTY-NINE FORESTS</span>
in England, of which the <span class="smcap">New Forest</span>,
<span class="smcap">Windsor Forest</span>,
<span class="smcap">Sherwood Forest</span>, and the
<span class="smcap">Forest of Dean</span>,
have always been considered the principal.
His Majesty's <span class="smcap lowercase">STAG HOUNDS</span>
are kept at the kennel
upon <i>Ascot Heath</i>, in <span class="smcap">Windsor Forest</span>, where he
has for some years enjoyed the pleasures of the chase.</p>

<p>The beasts of forest, in all ancient records, were
denominated "<span class="smcap lowercase">BEASTS OF VENERY</span>," and consisted
<span class="pagenum">{282}</span>
of the <i>Hart</i>, <i>Hind</i>, <i>Hare</i>, <i>Boar</i>, and <i>Wolf</i>: the
complete extinction of the two latter has, however,
long since rendered the term unnecessary, if not
entirely <i>obsolete</i>, and the whole is generally comprehended
under the appellation of <span class="smcap lowercase">GAME</span>, and the
<span class="smcap lowercase">LAWS</span> enacted to prevent its destruction.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>FOREST LAWS</h3><p>—are the laws framed for the
protection of <span class="smcap lowercase">VERT</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">VENISON</span> within the precincts
of a forest. It is the business, and the duty, of all
<i>subordinate</i> officers, to apprehend offenders of
whatever description, and present them to the
<span class="smcap lowercase">FOREST COURTS</span>,
in order to their being punished according
to the magnitude of the offence they may

<div class="combine">

<h3>FOREST COURTS</h3><p>—are the courts occasionally
held for executing the <span class="smcap lowercase">FOREST LAWS</span>. The
principal of which is, the Court of the <span class="smcap">Chief Justice</span>
in <span class="smcap">Eyre</span>; this is a court of <i>record</i>, and is held
only once in <i>three years</i>. The Court of <span class="smcap">Swainmote</span>
consists of the verderers, who, in some degree,
are the <span class="smcap lowercase">JUDGES</span>; as they receive presentments,
and hear evidence, as well as enquire of <i>offences</i> to
<i>convict</i>, but cannot pass judgment, that power being
reserved to the Court of the <span class="smcap">Chief Justice</span> (called
"<span class="smcap lowercase">JUSTICE SEAT</span>") alone. The Court of Swainmote
can only be held <i>three times a year</i>. The
<span class="smcap">Court of Attachment</span>
is likewise a meeting of the <span class="smcap lowercase">VERDERERS</span>,
<span class="pagenum">{283}</span>
and held once in <i>six weeks</i>, being called the
"<span class="smcap lowercase">FORTY DAYS COURT</span>."</p>

</div>

<p>During the time of the great camp upon <i>Bagshot
Heath</i>, the <span class="smcap">Duke</span> of
<span class="smcap">Richmond</span> having taken up his
temporary residence at the <i>Rose Inn</i>, <i>Wokingham</i>,
in <span class="smcap">Windsor Forest</span>, where the courts were occasionally
held, and seeing the regulations respecting
the <span class="smcap">Court</span> of
<span class="smcap">Attachment</span> fixed in the room, his
Grace wished to obtain some information upon the
subject; but finding none to be derived from the
waiter, he desired "a person might be sent up who
knew <i>something of the matter</i>." In a few minutes
appeared the son of the landlady, who most <i>sagaciously</i>
informed the <span class="smcap">Duke</span>, that the "<i>Forty Days
Court</i> was an <span class="smcap lowercase">ANNUAL MEETING</span>,
held every <i>six
weeks</i>;" with which very clear and explanatory account,
his Grace condescendingly expressed himself
"perfectly satisfied."</p>

<h3>FORM</h3><p>—is the spot in which the <span class="smcap lowercase">HARE</span>
takes her <i>seat</i> at the dawn of day, to secrete herself, after making
her various work in the night (or rather in the
early part of the morning) to avoid discovery. When
found <i>sitting</i>, she is said to be in her
<span class="smcap lowercase">FORM</span>. If
<i>shot</i> as she sits, without being previously disturbed,
she is then said to have been <i>shot in her form</i>.
<span class="smcap">Hares</span> vary their sitting according to the
<i>season</i>, the
<i>sun</i>, and the <i>wind</i>. Soon after harvest they are
found in wheat, barley, and oat stubbles, as well
<span class="pagenum">{284}</span>
as in rushy grassy moors; after these get bare, they
retire to <i>coverts</i>, <i>banks</i>, <i>hedges</i>, and <i>hedge-rows</i>.
After Christmas, and in the spring months, <i>dry
fallows</i>, particularly those laying towards the sun
with an ascent, are seldom without hares, if there
are any in the neighbourhood.</p>

<span class="smcap">Wild fowl</span>, comprehending, in the general sporting

curlews, plover, woodcocks, and snipes. <span class="smcap">Game fowl</span>,

<h3>FOWLING</h3><p>—is a term in some degree

applies generally to the pursuit of <i>water fowl</i>,

<span class="smcap lowercase">FOWLING</span> appertains
only to the sport of taking partridges with a

<span class="smcap lowercase">SPORTSMAN</span>,
suspended from a leathern belt passing round the
neck over his shoulder, for the purpose of receiving
such <span class="smcap lowercase">GAME</span>
as he may be able "<i>to bag</i>," or
"bring to <i>net</i>."</p>

<h3>FOWLING-PIECE</h3><p>—has been generally used
to imply a <span class="smcap lowercase">GUN</span> of
<i>any</i> description, so far as it was
applicable to the purpose of killing
<span class="smcap lowercase">GAME</span>, or, in
fact, <span class="smcap lowercase">WILD FOWL</span> of <i>any</i> kind.
It is, however, now

<h3>FOX</h3><p>.—The <span class="smcap lowercase">FOX</span>
is that well-known native animal
of this country whose instinctive <i>cunning</i> has rendered
it proverbial: they are common in most parts
of the kingdom, (as well as in Scotland,) but vary
so much in <i>size</i>, that a late writer has extended his
description to three different and <i>distinct</i> kinds.
He says, "There are three varieties of fox with
<span class="pagenum">{286}</span>
us, differing in form, but not in colour, except the
<i>cur</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">FOX</span>,
whose tip of the tail is black: they are
distinguished by the names of the <span class="smcap lowercase">GREYHOUND FOX</span>,
which is the tallest and boldest, and is chiefly found
in the mountainous parts of England and Scotland,
and will attack a well-grown sheep. The <span class="smcap lowercase">MASTIFF FOX</span>
is less, but his limbs more strongly formed.
The <span class="smcap lowercase">CUR FOX</span>
is the least, the most common, and is
the most pernicious to <span class="smcap lowercase">GAME</span>,
approaches nearer to
the habitations of mankind, lurks about the out-houses
of the <span class="smcap lowercase">FARMER</span>,
and destroys all the <span class="smcap lowercase">POULTRY</span>
it can get at."</p>

</div>

<p>Without descending to a minute examination of
this "<span class="smcap lowercase">VARIETY</span>," which probably may arise from
the force of a too fertile imagination, or the different
<i>growth</i> of <span class="smcap lowercase">FOXES</span>
in <i>different counties</i>, where
the <i>deficiency</i> of food, or the <i>difficulty</i> of <i>obtaining</i>
it, may occasion as great and proportional a variation
in the <i>size</i> of the <span class="smcap lowercase">ANIMAL</span>,
as may be observed
with the <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSES</span> of
<span class="smcap">Scotland</span> and <span class="smcap">Wales</span>, when
brought into competition with those produced in a
more fertile part of the kingdom; it must suffice to
explain his natural history as of <i>one species</i> only.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap lowercase">FOX</span>, when <i>tamed</i>
and subject to nice inspection,
is one of the most beautifully formed
animals in the creation; and when that <i>form</i> is critically
surveyed, the <i>possibility</i> of his persevering
<i>speed</i> before such immense bodies of <i>fleet</i> pursuers,
<span class="pagenum">{287}</span>
for so great a length of time, becomes matter of the
greatest admiration. Foxes are in colour of a
yellowish red, or rather yellow brown, having on
the forehead, the shoulders, as far as the root of
the tail, and the outside of the hind legs, a tinge of
dirty white or ash colour: the edges of the lips,
the cheeks, and the throat, are white; and a stripe
of the same runs along the under side of the legs:
the breast and belly are a lightish grey: the tips of
the ears and feet (sportingly termed <span class="smcap lowercase">PADS</span>) are
black: the tail (called <span class="smcap lowercase">BRUSH</span>)
reddish yellow, with
a blackish hue upon the surface; the tip itself pure white.</p>

<p>The fox in formation has great resemblance to
the <span class="smcap">dog</span>, but with some variations; his head is
larger in proportion to his body; his ears are
shorter; his tail thicker, and the hair longer: he
has a broad flat forehead, narrowing to a picked
nose; ears erect, and sharp at the point; eyes small,
and fiery in aspect, by which are easily observed
whether he is influenced by <span class="smcap lowercase">AFFECTION</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">ANGER</span>, or
<span class="smcap lowercase">FEAR</span>.
His sense of smelling is so instinctively exquisite,
that he can <i>wind</i> either his <i>prey</i> or his
enemy at a very considerable distance.</p>

<p>The sagacity of this animal, in the pursuit of his
prey, as well as his various modes of obtaining it,
are almost beyond description: his favourite objects
are <span class="smcap lowercase">GAME</span> of every kind,
<span class="smcap lowercase">RABBITS</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">POULTRY</span>
<span class="pagenum">{288}</span>
without exception, <span class="smcap lowercase">BIRDS</span>,
and the smaller quadrupeds.
In extreme hunger he will eat <i>mice</i>, <i>frogs</i>,
<i>snails</i>, and <i>insects</i>: some kinds of fruits and berries
also are not refused. <span class="smcap">Honey</span> he is remarkably fond
of; and, it is said, will even attack the <span class="smcap lowercase">HIVES</span>,
and hazard the event of <i>a battle</i>, rather than relinquish
the chance of so luxurious and delicious a repast.
The same sagacity regulates all his proceedings in
respect to bodily safety: when laying above ground,
it is generally in the most sequestered and unfrequented
places, and the most difficult of access;
when <i>at earth</i>, it is generally in the strong hold of
hard ground, exceedingly deep, of which some
<span class="smcap lowercase">BADGER</span> has been dispossessed,
(by the <span class="smcap lowercase">FOX'S</span> cunning
of depositing his excrement there,) or under
the roots of trees, by the diverse ramifications of
which he is shielded from every chance of extermination.</p>

<p>In his nocturnal depredations, he is in some degree
<i>systematic</i>, frequently selecting for his concealment
those small grassy-bottomed <span class="smcap lowercase">COVERTS</span> near the
small <i>hovels</i> and <i>thatched cottages</i> of the labouring
poor, where his lurking-place is the least suspected.
Here, in his recluse <span class="smcap lowercase">KENNEL</span>,
he enjoys the various
cackling of the different kinds of poultry, and
exultingly anticipates the intentional devastation.
When unrestrained, and in a state of liberty, he
seizes <span class="smcap lowercase">POULTRY</span> with a rapturous eagerness,
and ravenous
rapacity, absolutely incredible; his joy in
<span class="pagenum">{289}</span>
possession is demonstrated by the most inexpressible
<i>twistings</i> and <i>flirtings</i> of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">TAIL</span>, with other wanton
<i>gesticulations</i>, indicative of the highest possible
gratification. The first and most pressing sensations
of present <i>hunger</i> being satisfied, he prudently
provides for the <i>uncertainty</i> of the <i>future</i>: after the
annihilation (or safe deposit) of a <i>first</i>, he returns
for the <i>second</i>; that safely secured, either in a hole
dug for its reception, and covered with earth, or
secreted in his <i>kennel</i>, he comes for <i>a third</i>, which
is concealed in a similar manner, but not in the
same place, well knowing the impolicy of placing
<i>all</i> his <i>treasure</i> in <span class="smcap lowercase">ONE BANK</span>,
wisely recollecting,
that should <span class="smcap lowercase">BANKRUPTCY</span>
happen in <i>one place</i>, it can
prove no <i>bad maxim</i> to have
<span class="smcap lowercase">EFFECTS</span> in another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fortune</span> not always favoring him at the <i>same
points</i>, he has his <span class="smcap lowercase">ALTERNATIVES</span>:
as it is the <i>misfortune</i>
annexed to his very <span class="smcap lowercase">NATURE</span> to afford
<i>sport</i>
to <i>others</i>, so, with all the retaliation in his power,
he frequently finds <i>sport</i> for <i>himself</i>. To the helpless,
inoffensive <span class="smcap lowercase">LEVERETS</span>,
during the early part of
the season, he frequently gives chase, particularly
on moon-light nights, with too much success. In
this pursuit he vents a sensation of pleasure, partaking
more of a <i>yelping whimper</i> than a distinct
<i>bark</i>: he seizes old <span class="smcap lowercase">HARES</span>
in their <i>forms</i>; perseveringly
digs <i>rabbits</i> out of their <i>burrows</i>; is indefatigable
in the search after, and discovery of,
<span class="smcap lowercase">PHEASANTS</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">PARTRIDGES</span> upon their <i>nests</i>, which
<span class="pagenum">{290}</span>
he instantly destroys. The fatigue he undergoes by
night in quest of prey, occasions him to sleep <i>much</i>,
and sometimes exceedingly <i>sound</i>, by
<span class="smcap lowercase">DAY</span>: instances
have been frequent of <span class="smcap lowercase">HOUNDS</span> drawing up
to, and killing them <i>in kennel</i>, without <i>a drag</i>;
as well as of their being found sleeping in the sunny
banks of hedge-rows, and shot by <span class="smcap lowercase">FARMERS</span>,
(basking as they lay,) without being previously disturbed.</p>

<p>The naturally rank and offensive smell of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">FOX</span> renders it a rich <i>scent</i>
to <span class="smcap lowercase">HOUNDS</span>, which they
evidently evince when it <i>lays well</i>, and they are
running <span class="smcap lowercase">BREAST HIGH</span>;
at which time the <i>crows</i>,
<i>magpies</i>, and <i>jays</i>, (who consider him an invincible
and cruel enemy,) give clamorous proofs of his
presence, by hovering over him with their screams
of exultation at his impending fate, so long as they
can keep him <i>in view</i>. They copulate (or go to
<i>clicket</i>, as it is called) in the winter, and produce
cubs during the month of April, and the first week
in May: they have but one litter a year; an
<span class="smcap lowercase">OLD VIXEN</span>
frequently bringing from <i>six</i> to <i>nine</i> cubs;
a <span class="smcap lowercase">VIXEN</span> of the <i>first</i>
or <i>second</i> year not so many.
They are known to grow for eighteen months, and
to live, even in a <i>tame state</i>, for fourteen or fifteen
years.</p>

<p>Doubts have arisen, and opposite opinions have
been strenuously supported, upon the question whether
the <span class="smcap lowercase">FOX</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">DOG</span> will generate an
<span class="smcap lowercase">OFFSPRING</span> to
<span class="pagenum">{291}</span>
which the <i>prolific</i> powers shall continue in successive
perpetuity: this seems to be positively ascertained
in the <span class="smcap lowercase">AFFIRMATIVE</span>, with one exception,
which is, that the act of copulation will be effected
only by the <span class="smcap lowercase">DOG FOX</span> with
a <i>bitch</i> of the <span class="smcap lowercase">CANINE SPECIES</span>.</p>

<p>Instances of the extreme <i>cunning</i>, and innate <i>sagacity</i>,
of <span class="smcap lowercase">FOXES</span>, when hunted, and in returning
<i>twenty</i> and <i>thirty</i> miles to the coverts where they
have been first found, are upon record, and almost
innumerable. Their <span class="smcap lowercase">COURAGE</span>,
as well as the
<i>strength</i> of their <i>jaws</i>, are beyond conception:
they defend themselves to the last extremity; no
blows deter them from their hold: their bite is severe
and dangerous, as they make their teeth meet
through a strong and thick hand. When caught by
the <span class="smcap lowercase">HOUNDS</span>,
they are silently resolute even in
<span class="smcap lowercase">DEATH</span>;
for revengefully <i>seizing</i> upon the <i>first</i> assailant,
their hold is never relinquished but with the last gasp.</p>

<h3>FOX-HUNTING</h3><p>—has been for time immemorial
a favourite sport with the natives of this kingdom,
particularly in the prime of life; the pleasing
exercise, and bodily exertion, contributing greatly
to the <span class="smcap lowercase">PRESERVATION</span> of
<span class="smcap lowercase">HEALTH</span>; but the <i>fatigue</i>
and <i>danger</i> render it but ill-adapted to the
<span class="smcap lowercase">AGED</span>,
the <span class="smcap lowercase">INFIRM</span>, and the
<span class="smcap lowercase">VALETUDINARIAN</span>. The persevering
speed and fortitude of the <span class="smcap lowercase">GAME</span>,
the constantly
<span class="pagenum">{292}</span>
improving high mettled excellence of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">HOUNDS</span>,
the invincible spirit of the <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSES</span>, and
the unrestrained ardour of their <span class="smcap lowercase">RIDERS</span>, have given
it a decided superiority over every other <span class="smcap lowercase">FIELD SPORT</span>
ever yet known to the people of this country.
Its salutary effect upon both the <span class="smcap lowercase">BODY</span>
and <span class="smcap lowercase">MIND</span>, has
established its enjoyment upon a basis too broad
ever to be shaken, even by time itself: the superlative
pleasure of every scene, the diversities of the
aggregate, and the extacy with which the whole is
embraced by its infinity of devotees, have reduced
the sport to a system of perfection never before
known; and in this some of the most <span class="smcap lowercase">LEARNED</span>, the
most <span class="smcap lowercase">EMINENT</span>, and the most
<span class="smcap lowercase">OPULENT</span> characters
are principally and personally engaged in nearly
<i>every county</i>, from one extremity of the kingdom
to the other.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fox-hunting</span> seems to be possessed of a <i>charm</i>,
or magical inspiration, within itself, that even the
most serious, the most cynical, and the most singular,
cannot, with all the firmness of their resolves,
summon resolution to withstand. It is the
very kind of rapturous gratification to which every
effort of the pen becomes inadequate in its attempts
at description; it must be <i>seen</i> to be <i>understood</i>; it
must be <span class="smcap lowercase">FELT</span> to be
<span class="smcap lowercase">ENJOYED</span>.
A <span class="smcap lowercase">FOX-HUNTING ESTABLISHMENT</span>
consists, in general, of what it has
done for the last century past, at least with those
<span class="smcap lowercase">PACKS</span> most celebrated for the
<span class="smcap lowercase">EMINENCE</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">OPULENCE</span>
<span class="pagenum">{293}</span>
of their <span class="smcap lowercase">OWNERS</span>. The principal and second
<span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTSMAN</span>, the first and second
<span class="smcap lowercase">WHIPPER-IN</span>, three
horses kept for <i>each</i> of the <i>first</i>, and two <i>each</i> for
<i>both</i> the <i>last</i>; from <span class="smcap lowercase">TWENTY-FIVE</span>
to <span class="smcap lowercase">THIRTY-FIVE</span>
couple of <span class="smcap lowercase">HOUNDS</span>, <i>terriers</i>,
<i>helpers</i>, <i>earth-stoppers</i>,
<i>dog-feeders</i>, and a long list of <i>et ceteras</i>, too numerous
for minute description. Those who wish
to acquire a <i>systematic</i> knowledge of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">SPORT</span>, (so
far as it can be obtained from <span class="smcap lowercase">THEORY</span>,)
will do
well to peruse attentively "<span class="smcap">Mr. Beckford's</span>
Thoughts upon Hunting, in a Series of familiar
<span class="smcap">Letters to a Friend</span>."—They are so truly the effusions
of sound judgment, and so replete with the
useful remarks of an experienced sportsman, that
there is no room for any thing <span class="smcap lowercase">NEW</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">ADDITIONAL</span>
to be introduced upon the subject.</p>

<h3>FREE WARREN</h3><p>.—A <span class="smcap lowercase">FREE WARREN</span> is a term
totally distinct from <span class="smcap lowercase">FOREST</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">CHACE</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">PARK</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">MANOR</span>,
or <span class="smcap lowercase">WARREN</span>;
it is a <i>franchise</i> derived originally from
<span class="smcap">the Crown</span>; and the person having a grant of free
warren over certain lands, possesses a <span class="smcap lowercase">SOLE RIGHT</span>
of <i>pursuing</i>, <i>taking</i>, and <i>killing</i>
<span class="smcap lowercase">GAME</span> of every
kind within its limits; although there may be no
<i>one acre</i> of land his <i>own property</i> through the whole
district where he is possessed of this right. There
are instances where a variety of circumstances render
manorial rights and privileges so complex, and
<i>seemingly</i> indefinite, as to produce litigation without
personal enmity, but merely that the <span class="smcap">right</span>
<span class="pagenum">{294}</span>
shall be <span class="smcap lowercase">LEGALLY</span> ascertained. It appears that
where <span class="smcap lowercase">MANOR LANDS</span> are situate in, and surrounded
by, a <span class="smcap lowercase">FREE WARREN</span>, the owner of such lands may
<i>kill game</i> within his <i>own</i> manor, but he cannot introduce
even a qualified person to <span class="smcap lowercase">KILL GAME</span> there
<i>also</i>, without the consent of the owner or possessor
of the privilege of <span class="smcap lowercase">FREE WARREN</span> over the whole;
if so, the person introduced <i>killing game</i>, will be
liable to an action for trespass, which action will lie.</p>

</div>

<p>A curious cause came on to be tried before a
jury at the summer assizes of the present year,
1802, held at <span class="smcap">Abingdon</span>, for the county of
<span class="smcap">Berks</span>,
wherein <span class="smcap">John Westbrook</span>, Gent. of the parish of
<span class="smcap">Bray</span>, (situate in Windsor Forest,) was
<span class="smcap lowercase">PLAINTIFF</span>,
and a Game-keeper of his Majesty's the <span class="smcap lowercase">DEFENDANT</span>.
The action was brought to try the <span class="smcap lowercase">RIGHT</span>
of the <span class="smcap lowercase">DEFENDANT</span>,
as one of his Majesty's keepers, to <span class="smcap lowercase">KILL GAME</span>
within the <i>enclosed grounds</i> of the <span class="smcap lowercase">PLAINTIFF</span>,
situate in, and surrounded by, the <i>wastes</i>, <i>commons</i>,
and within the boundaries of the said <span class="smcap lowercase">FOREST</span>.
When, without adverting to the <span class="smcap">laws</span> relative to
forests <i>only</i>, (with which the question was totally
unconnected,) the Court held it good, that <span class="smcap">the King</span>,
possessing a <span class="smcap lowercase">FREE WARREN</span> over the
<span class="smcap lowercase">WHOLE</span>,
possessed likewise the privilege of appointing a
<span class="smcap lowercase">KEEPER</span> to kill game upon <i>any</i>,
and within <i>every</i>,
part of the said <span class="smcap lowercase">FREE WARREN</span>,
without the least exception
as to <i>enclosed lands</i>, the property of <i>others</i>;
<span class="pagenum">{295}</span>
when the jury instantly found for the <span class="smcap">defendant</span>,
by which the right is fully confirmed.</p>

<p>This being a question of <i>privilege</i>, tried on the
part of an individual against the prerogative of
<span class="smcap">the Crown</span>,
it might be fairly considered conclusive
upon the subject of <span class="smcap lowercase">FREE WARREN</span>;
but as it cannot
be too clearly understood, for the prevention of ill
neighbourhood, and expensive litigation, another
decision is subjoined, which took place about the
same time, though in a different county.</p>

<p>On the 12th of July, in the same year, a writ of
inquiry was executed before the Under Sheriff at
Hertford, in an action wherein <span class="smcap">Henry Browne</span>,
of North Mimms, Esq. was <span class="smcap lowercase">PLAINTIFF</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Thomas Greenwood</span>, the Younger,
<span class="smcap lowercase">DEFENDANT</span>.
The action was brought for a trespass committed
by the <span class="smcap lowercase">DEFENDANT</span>, in
<i>shooting game</i> within the
<span class="smcap lowercase">FREE WARREN</span> belonging to the
<span class="smcap lowercase">PLAINTIFF</span>, who is
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> of the <span class="smcap">Manor</span>
of North Mimms, and entitled
to free warren through the whole of the Manor. It
appeared, that the land on which the trespass
was committed, and the <i>game killed</i>, by the
<span class="smcap lowercase">DEFENDANT</span>,
was <i>not, in point of fact</i>, the land of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">PLAINTIFF</span>, but, on the contrary, belonged to
<span class="smcap">Justinian Casamajor</span>, Esq. However, as it was
proved to be within the Manor of North Mimms,
and the right of free warren extending over the
whole of the Manor, <span class="smcap">the Jury</span>, after considering
<span class="pagenum">{296}</span>
the circumstances of the case, and the defendant's
conduct, who persisted in shooting <i>after being warned
to the contrary</i>, gave a verdict of <span class="smcap lowercase">TEN POUNDS</span>
with costs.</p>

<h3>FRET</h3><p>.—The disorder which (in the country) is
called by this name, is the <span class="smcap lowercase">FLATULENT CHOLIC</span>,
and occasioned from a retention of wind, and a rarefaction
of air in the intestinal canal. It is immediately
discoverable by the fulness and extreme
tension of the carcase, the agonizing pain of the
horse, the rumbling of the confined air, the partial
and very trifling expulsions of wind, the laboured
respiration, frequent groaning, suddenly laying
down, and as hastily rising, constant looking back
to the flank on one side or the other, as if soliciting
relief from those who surround him. The great
and leading object is, to promote a plentiful
<span class="smcap lowercase">EXPULSION</span>
of <span class="smcap lowercase">WIND</span>: this is in general followed by
excrementitious discharges, by which ease is obtained,
and the disorder near at an end. Warm,
spicy, aromatic <span class="smcap lowercase">CARMINATIVES</span>,
blended with <span class="smcap lowercase">ANODYNES</span>,
are the medicines best adapted to this species
of <span class="smcap lowercase">CHOLIC</span>, and to which it speedily submits; more
particularly if plenty of <span class="smcap lowercase">ASSISTANTS</span>
are at hand to
bestow the necessary portion of <i>flank rubbing</i>, (and
belly wisping,) to an unceasing perseverance in
which, success is <i>equally</i> to be depended upon with
the administration of <span class="smcap lowercase">MEDICINE</span>;
as in most cases
<span class="pagenum">{297}</span>
little is to be expected from one without collateral
aid from the other.</p>

<h3>FROG</h3><p>,—in <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSES</span>,
is the centrical soft kind of
horny substance at the bottom of the foot, spreading
wide from the heel, having a cleft in the middle,
and terminating in a point toward the toe. To the
internal parts the lower extremity of the <span class="smcap lowercase">TENDONS</span>
are attached, and the <span class="smcap lowercase">FROG</span>
is the basis by which
their <i>elasticity</i> is supported, and from whence is
derived the <i>deceptive</i> reasoning, that the
<span class="smcap lowercase">FROG</span> must
indispensibly (in action) <i>touch</i> the <i>ground</i>. The
frog is subject to a defect, called the
<span class="smcap lowercase">FRUSH</span>, or
<span class="smcap lowercase">THRUSH</span>, and this, when become virulent, is termed
<i>running thrush</i>: it sometimes arises from internal
heat, by standing too much upon <i>foul hot litter</i>,
(particularly in the livery stables of the Metropolis,)
as well as from a <span class="smcap lowercase">STAGNANT</span> state of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">FLUIDS</span> in the extremities,
for want of <i>proper exercise</i>,
leg rubbing, and keeping the feet clean.</p>

may be considered a distinguishing, and almost
invariable sign of both good spirit and sound bottom;
for a <i>dull jade</i>, or a <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSE</span>
of the <i>sluggish
cart breed</i>, is very rarely to be seen with this appearance.
It is also no inferior criterion of
<span class="smcap lowercase">HEALTH</span>, and may, in general, be considered truly
<span class="pagenum">{298}</span>
indicative of <span class="smcap lowercase">CONDITION</span>: few, if any, horses of

In want of these, or where they are difficult

previously beaten to powder in a mortar. This

<h3>FUNGUS</h3><p>—is the too-fast shooting granulations

particularly in <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSES</span>,
with whom it is invariably

in constituting <i>an eschar</i> upon the surface,

Slight scarifications, both transverse and longitudinal,

<h3><span class="smcap">GALLS, or GALLING</span></h3><p>.—Lacerations occasioned
by the too tight pressure and friction of an
uneasy and ill-fitted saddle, or heavy harness, are
so called. They are seldom seen with either the
judicious or the enlightened; experience having
taught <i>both</i> how to appreciate <span class="smcap lowercase">PREVENTION</span>.
The prudent <span class="smcap lowercase">SPORTSMAN</span> will never
take his horse to the field, nor the humane driver his carriage-horse to
the road, till personal examination has convinced
him the necessary apparatus is not only <i>firm</i>, but
proportionally <i>easy</i>; and this should become the
more predominant in memory, because it is natural
to conclude, no man existing would, by neglect or
inattention, give <i>pain</i> to the very animal from
whose exertions he is to derive his own
<span class="smcap lowercase">PLEASURE</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>Injuries of this description, if unexpectedly sustained,
should be immediately attended to; a repetition,
and <i>that soon</i>, upon the part so injured,
is frequently productive of trouble, expence, loss
of time, and disappointment. When the side of a
horse is <i>galled</i>, as it sometimes is, by the girth-buckle
having been most improperly placed upon
the <i>edge</i> of the <i>pad</i>, it is not unlikely, for want of
early or proper attention, to terminate in a
<span class="smcap lowercase">SITFAST</span>,
and then can only be completely cured by
<span class="pagenum">{301}</span>
extirpation with <i>the knife</i>. The
<span class="smcap lowercase">WITHERS</span> being
affected in the same way, and the saddle or harness
continued in use by which the injury was originally
occasioned, the foundation of <span class="smcap lowercase">FISTULA</span>
may be laid, and will be likely to ensue. In all slight and
superficial galls, two or three moistenings of the
part with cold vinegar will allay the inflammation,
and harden the surface; but where the long-continued
<i>heat</i> and <i>friction</i> has occasioned a destruction
of parts, it must be dressed and managed as a
wound, which can only be completely cured by
incarnation.</p>

<h3>GALLOP</h3><p>—is one pace of <span class="smcap lowercase">THE HORSE</span>,
well known by that general name; though it will admit
of gradational distinctions. A <span class="smcap lowercase">CANTER</span>
is the slowest gallop, in which a horse bears most upon his
haunches, but lightly on the bit; it is a pace
which spirited, good-tempered horses seem to enjoy,
and is peculiarly calculated for the accommodation
of a lady. A <span class="smcap lowercase">RATING-GALLOP</span> is the
increase of action to such pace, as the particular
horse may or can go with ease <i>at his rate</i> in common
stroke without being exerted <i>to speed</i>; and
this is the <span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTING GALLOP</span> of thorough
<span class="smcap lowercase">BRED HORSES</span>,
who will always lay by the <i>side</i> of
<span class="smcap lowercase">HOUNDS</span>
at it, without being in the least distrest.
A <span class="smcap lowercase">BRUSHING GALLOP</span>
upon the <span class="smcap lowercase">TURF</span>, implies an increased

<h3>GAME</h3><p>—for the preservation of which such a

of <span class="smcap">Parliament</span>, extended to "the <i>Heron</i>, <i>Pigeon</i>,
<i>Mallard</i>, <i>Duck</i>, <i>Teal</i>, <i>Widgeon</i>, or any <i>such Fowl</i>;"
but in the present construction, <span class="smcap lowercase">GAME</span> is generally

<h3>GAME COCK</h3><p>.—The true-bred <span class="smcap lowercase">GAME COCK</span> is a
species of fowl almost peculiar to this country;
his natural and instinctive courage will never permit
him to yield to an opponent, however he may
be superior in <span class="smcap lowercase">WEIGHT</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">STRENGTH</span>; but he will,
even under those disadvantages, continue to fight
till literally <i>cut to pieces</i>. After the <i>loss of eyes</i>,
with the body wounded and perforated in every
part, when even the <i>use</i> of his <i>legs</i> are <i>gone</i>, and
he is no longer able to stand, but lays extended
upon <i>the sod</i>, with his victorious opponent exultingly
<span class="pagenum">{304}</span>
<span class="smcap lowercase">CROWING</span> over his mangled frame, he will
continue to <i>shew fight</i> with his <i>beak</i>, to the last remains
of life.</p>

</div>

<p>Those <span class="smcap lowercase">NOBLEMEN</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">GENTLEMEN</span> who have
(from hereditary rule, and local custom) continued
the sport of <span class="smcap lowercase">COCKING</span>,
in the neighbourhoods where
their country mansions and landed estates lay, have
been, and are, exceedingly circumspect and cautious
in the <span class="smcap lowercase">BREED</span>,
lest any chance of contamination
should <i>creep in</i>, by an injudicious, improper,
or unlucky, <i>cross in the blood</i>;
for as some <span class="smcap lowercase">HUNDREDS</span>
of <span class="smcap lowercase">POUNDS</span> are frequently depending upon
<span class="smcap lowercase">ONE MAIN</span>, and that main upon the battle of <i>a single
cock</i>, no such money can be betted with a probable
or equal <i>chance</i> of <i>winning</i>, unless the unsullied
purity of the <span class="smcap lowercase">BREED</span> is most accurately ascertained.
In confirmation of which remark, it is to be observed,
that whenever a <span class="smcap lowercase">COCK</span>, in
<span class="smcap lowercase">FIGHTING</span>, declines
the battle, no longer faces his adversary,
but repeatedly <i>turns tail</i>, and <i>runs away</i>, his blood
is no longer to be relied on; and such cock has not
only his neck broke in the Pit, but the whole of
that breed are destroyed, to prevent farther contamination,
as well as future loss, disgrace, and disappointment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Game cocks</span> are bred of various colours, according
to the fancy or opinion of different <span class="smcap lowercase">AMATEURS</span>,
many of whom have their favourite plumage;
<span class="pagenum">{305}</span>
their colours are technically described by
the variations in feather, and are as follow: The
black or pheasant-breasted <span class="smcap lowercase">RED</span>; the black-breasted
<span class="smcap lowercase">GINGER</span>; the speckle-breasted
<span class="smcap">ginger dun</span>; the
black-breasted <span class="smcap lowercase">YELLOW DUCKWING</span>;
the turkey-breasted
<span class="smcap lowercase">DITTO</span>; the
<span class="smcap lowercase">SMUTTY DUN</span>;
the <span class="smcap lowercase">BRASS-WINGED BLACK</span>; and the
<span class="smcap lowercase">SMOCK</span>,
which is a <i>milk-white</i>,
having the appearance of a common <i>barn-door
fowl</i>; and the odds are proportionally against
them whenever they are brought <span class="smcap">to Pit</span>, which is
now but seldom, the breed being nearly or quite
destroyed.</p>

<p>Two opinions have always been, and still are,
entertained respecting <span class="smcap lowercase">THE COCKS</span> most proper to
breed from, admitting the standard of <i>bone</i>, <i>strength</i>,
<i>weight</i>, and <i>standing</i>, to be just the same. Some
prefer breeding from <span class="smcap lowercase">A COCK</span> who has
<span class="smcap lowercase">WON</span> many
<i>hard-fought</i> battles, by which his <i>own blood</i> is so
fairly proved; whilst others maintain the consistency
of breeding only from the <i>full brothers</i> of
such, (who are called <span class="smcap lowercase">MAIDEN COCKS</span>, as never
having fought,) under an impression, that the
former must have sustained material injury by the
<i>wounds</i> received, and the <i>blood lost</i>, in the battles he
had formerly fought. However those who
<span class="smcap lowercase">BREED GAME FOWL</span>
may differ upon this particular point,
it is an opinion nearly unanimous, that if you
breed entirely for the Pit, that no cock should be
bred from younger than <span class="smcap lowercase">TWO</span>,
or more than <span class="smcap lowercase">SIX</span>,
<span class="pagenum">{306}</span>
years old. Although it is right to breed from a
strong, bony, close-made, majestic, high-standing
cock, yet it is by no means prudent so to do from
cocks <i>much above</i> match weight; that is to say,
never to exceed <span class="smcap lowercase">FOUR POUNDS, TWELVE OUNCES</span>,
at the utmost; for should the <span class="smcap lowercase">HENS</span> prove large
also, the <i>progeny</i> might run still more into <i>size</i> and
<i>bone</i>, and never fall into any match whatever.</p>

<p>In breeding <span class="smcap lowercase">GAME CHICKEN</span>,
to breed with success,
there are some general rules, which should be
strictly attended to, and invariably persevered in.
No <span class="smcap lowercase">BROOD-COCK</span> should walk with more than <i>four
hens</i>; three being, in fact, fully sufficient. <span class="smcap">Game hens</span>
should never be permitted to bring forth a
clutch of chickens before the <i>last</i> week in <span class="smcap">February</span>,
nor after the <i>first</i> week in <span class="smcap">May</span>; those
hatched in <span class="smcap">March</span> and
<span class="smcap">April</span> are only adapted to
<span class="smcap">the Pit</span>, and are always preferable, in
<span class="smcap lowercase">SIZE</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">GROWTH</span>, to those hatched at
<i>any other</i> season of the
year. Hens after hatching should be <i>cooped asunder</i>,
where the chickens cannot intermix; as the
hens will not only <i>kill</i> the <i>young</i> of <i>each other</i>, but
<span class="smcap lowercase">FIGHT THEMSELVES</span> with the same inveteracy as
<span class="smcap lowercase">THE COCKS</span>. If a game hen, with chicken,
retreats when attacked by another in the same state, her
produce has been suspected to prove, in future,
<i>defective in courage</i>; this opinion has, however,
been founded upon false principles; because it is a
very common circumstance for the younger hen to
<span class="pagenum">{307}</span>
give place to an older, as it always is for
<span class="smcap lowercase">THE STAG</span>
to submit to the <span class="smcap lowercase">OLD COCK</span>,
who must and will continue master of his walk.</p>

<p>During the first year after being hatched, they
are called individually <span class="smcap lowercase">CHICKEN</span>; from twelve
months to two years old, they are termed <span class="smcap lowercase">STAGS</span>,
and from that period called <span class="smcap lowercase">COCKS</span>, being then
thought in <i>their prime</i>; but they are probably
more so <span class="smcap lowercase">AT THREE</span>, if properly walked.
<span class="smcap">Cock chickens</span>
should never be permitted to run too
long together, but be separated as soon as they
begin fighting <i>with each other</i>; and this ought to
be the more strictly attended to, because it frequently
happens, that out of a <i>whole clutch</i>, by
neglect or inattention, what with <i>scalped heads</i>,
<i>loss of eyes</i>, <i>broken beaks</i>, or <i>deformed feet</i>, not one
has ever been brought to the scale.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cock chicken</span>, when first removed, at <i>three</i> or
<i>four</i> months old, are placed where they continue
to walk under an <span class="smcap lowercase">OLD COCK</span>, and will continue
obedient and submissive till <i>nine</i> and <i>ten</i>, or sometimes
<span class="smcap lowercase">TWELVE MONTHS</span> old; the experiment is
nevertheless too hazardous to be made; they had
much better be taken to a <span class="smcap lowercase">MASTER-WALK</span> in proper
time, to avoid the probability of either <i>one</i> or
<i>both</i> being <span class="smcap lowercase">SPOILED</span>.
The most eminent <span class="smcap lowercase">BREEDERS</span>,
as well as the most enthusiastic <span class="smcap lowercase">BETTERS</span>,
have one mode of endeavouring to fix a criterion, how far
<span class="pagenum">{308}</span>
they can depend upon <i>the heel</i>, <i>the fight</i>, and <i>the
blood</i>, of any particular <span class="smcap lowercase">BREED</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">CROSS</span> they may
have been induced to adopt. This experiment
(dreadfully <i>cruel</i> as it is) is termed
"<span class="smcap lowercase">CUTTING OUT</span>,"
and consists in <i>pitting</i> such <span class="smcap lowercase">CHICKEN</span>
of <i>seven</i>, <i>eight</i>, or <i>nine</i> months old, <i>unarmed</i>, against their
own brothers, or others of superior <i>age</i>, <i>weight</i>,
and <i>strength</i>, having <span class="smcap lowercase">SILVER SPURS</span>; if the chicken,
so unarmed, and without the least chance of success,
continues the combat till completely <i>deprived
of life</i>, without displaying the least tendency to
cowardice, or consciousness of defeat, more of his
brothers have the same severe and "fiery ordeal"
to undergo, when, if the result is just the same,
the <i>cross</i> is admitted to be <i>good</i>, and the
<span class="smcap lowercase">BREED</span> is
persevered in, till, from circumstances, the blood
is thought to degenerate, when new crosses are
adopted, and new experiments made. See <span class="smcap">Cocking, Cock-match</span>,

<h3>GAMING</h3><p>—is that destructive vice which has
annihilated some of the most princely fortunes in
this, and, perhaps, in every other kingdom: it is
a whirlwind of devastating infatuation, which destroys
every thing before it: like the effect of unrestrained
fire, it continues its ravages so long as

The most <span class="smcap lowercase">MAGNIFICENT MANSIONS</span>,

and successfully exerted against them without exception.
Houses of this description are appropriated

<span class="smcap lowercase">SYSTEMATIC DEPREDATORS</span>,
"who shun the light;"
men who have no <i>credit</i> to <i>support</i>, no <i>reputation</i>
to <i>lose</i>; and who are as completely lost to every

from the respectable classes of society. Here it is
where the young, the inexperienced, the injudicious,

their <span class="smcap lowercase">OWN</span>,

<span class="smcap lowercase">PARTRIDGES</span>, or other game, within the precincts
of such manor, in the possession of any person not
qualified to keep the same. It does not appear by
this act (23d Charles Second, c. xxv. s. 2) that a
<span class="smcap lowercase">GAME-KEEPER</span> is empowered to seize
<span class="smcap lowercase">THE GAME</span>, although
he is authorized to take all instruments in
use for the destruction of it.</p>

<p>By the 25th George Third, c. v. s. 2, every <i>deputation</i>
of a <span class="smcap lowercase">GAME-KEEPER</span> granted to any person,
by any <span class="smcap lowercase">LORD</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">LADY</span> of any
<span class="smcap lowercase">MANOR</span> in England or
Wales, shall be <i>registered</i> with the
<span class="smcap">Clerk</span> of <span class="smcap">the Peace</span>
of the county in which such manor lies;
where he shall receive a certificate of such registry,
upon payment of <span class="smcap lowercase">ONE GUINEA</span>, and one shilling to
the Clerk, for the same. A game-keeper omitting
to register his deputation, and to take out his certificate,
for <i>twenty days</i>, to forfeit
<span class="smcap lowercase">TWENTY POUNDS</span>.
The certificate must be renewed <i>annually</i>; and
upon the appointment of a
<span class="smcap lowercase">NEW GAME-KEEPER</span>, a
<i>new certificate</i> must be taken out; and the person
formerly acting under the old certificate is no
longer <i>qualified</i> to <i>kill game</i>, but liable to all the
penalties of this act.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{313}</div>

<p>In addition, a few general remarks may be useful.
A <span class="smcap lowercase">GAME-KEEPER</span> having no other qualification
than his <i>deputation</i> and <i>certificate</i>, is not entitled to
<span class="smcap lowercase">KILL GAME</span> out of the precincts of the manor for
which he is appointed. Nor is he empowered to
demand <span class="smcap lowercase">THE NAME</span>, or a
<span class="smcap lowercase">SIGHT</span>, of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">CERTIFICATE</span>
of any qualified person <i>out</i> of his <i>own</i> district; unless
he is qualified to kill game in his <span class="smcap lowercase">OWN RIGHT</span>,
(exclusive of his deputation,) and is possessed of
his <span class="smcap lowercase">THREE GUINEA</span> certificate; in which case he
may do either or both. But let it be remembered,
that, although he is <span class="smcap lowercase">QUALIFIED</span> to
<span class="smcap lowercase">KILL GAME</span> in his
own right, and acts under a <i>deputation</i> for a certain
specified <span class="smcap lowercase">MANOR</span>,
he is liable to the penalty prescribed
by the Act, if he is informed against for,
and convicted of, killing game out of that manor,
without being previously possessed of the three
guinea certificate. Any <span class="smcap lowercase">GAME-KEEPER</span>
killing or taking a hare, pheasant, partridge, or other game,
under colour of being for the use of the Lord of
the Manor, and afterwards <span class="smcap lowercase">SELLING</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">DISPOSING</span>
thereof, without the consent of the said <span class="smcap">Lord</span> of
the <span class="smcap">Manor</span>, upon conviction, on the complaint of
such Lord, and on the oath of one witness, before
a Justice, shall be committed to the house of correction
for three months, and there kept to hard
labour.</p>

<h3>GAME LAWS</h3><p>.—The laws framed for the
<span class="smcap lowercase">PRESERVATION</span> of
<span class="smcap lowercase">THE GAME</span>, are, by the different
<span class="pagenum">{314}</span>
<span class="smcap">Acts</span> of <span class="smcap">Parliament</span>,
during several successive
reigns, become so truly voluminous, and in many
instances thought so truly complex, that it is impracticable
to reduce any moderate abridgement of
the whole within the intentional limits of this
Work. But as many of the former Acts (at least
<i>many</i> of the <i>clauses</i> in those Acts) though unrepealed,
are in practice almost obsolete, it is proposed
(divested of legal tautology) to bring a review
of the existing parts of the <span class="smcap lowercase">GAME LAWS</span> as they
now stand, and as they are now acted upon, into
as concise a point of view as the subject will admit;
and so perfectly free from ambiguity, as to be rendered
perfectly clear to the most moderate comprehension:
at least as much so, as can be expected
upon <span class="smcap lowercase">LAWS</span>, that,
after all the refinement of <span class="smcap lowercase">CENTURIES</span>,
after all the investigation and deliberation of
the different <span class="smcap">Legislatures</span>,
and the advantages derived
also from the sage opinions of the most learned
in <span class="smcap lowercase">THE LAW</span>,
are certainly less respected, and less
effectual, than any other part of the code to be
found in the statute books of this realm. Whether
it is, that they are less understood, less palatable
to those interested in their effect, or but feebly and
partially executed, is a matter only to be ascertained
by time, and such future arrangements as
may probably take place.</p>

</div>

<p>Persons held legally qualified to kill game, must
be in the full and undisputed possession of a
<span class="smcap lowercase">FREEHOLD LANDED ESTATE</span>,
<span class="pagenum">{315}</span>
producing a clear 100<i>l.</i> <i>per
annum</i>; or possessed of a lease, or leases, for ninety-nine
years, or any longer term, of the clear yearly
value of 150<i>l.</i> other than the heir apparent of an
Esquire, or other person of higher degree. <span class="smcap">Esquires</span>,
as defined by <span class="smcap lowercase">LAW</span>, are the younger sons
of <span class="smcap">Noblemen</span>, and their heirs male for ever: the
four Esquires of the King's body: the eldest sons
of <span class="smcap">Baronets</span>, of
<span class="smcap">Knights</span> of the <span class="smcap">Bath</span>, of Knights
Bachelors, and their heirs male in the right line.
A <span class="smcap">Justice</span> of the <span class="smcap">Peace</span>
is also an Esquire for the
time he is in the commission, but no longer.</p>

<p>Persons of higher degree than Esquires, are <span class="smcap">Colonels</span>,
<span class="smcap">Serjeants at Law</span>, and <span class="smcap">Doctors</span> in the
three learned Professions; but neither Esquires, nor
any of these, are qualified to kill game, unless they
have the requisite estate mentioned; though their
<span class="smcap lowercase">SONS</span> are qualified without <i>any</i> estate.
This, however unreasonable it may seem, has been fully decided
to be the true construction of the Act. In
addition to every necessary <span class="smcap lowercase">QUALIFICATION</span> by
<span class="smcap lowercase">ESTATE</span>,
according to the construction of all former
Acts, it is enacted, by 25th George Third, c. 1. s. 2,
That every person in Great Britain who shall use
any dog, gun, net, or other engine, for the taking
or destruction of game, shall every year, previously
to his using the same, deliver in a paper, or account
in writing, containing his name and place of
abode, to the <span class="smcap">Clerk</span> of
<span class="smcap">the Peace</span> of the county
<span class="pagenum">{316}</span>
where he shall reside, (or his deputy,) and annually
take out <span class="smcap lowercase">A CERTIFICATE</span> of having so done, for
which he is to pay <span class="smcap lowercase">THREE GUINEAS</span>,
and one shilling
to the Clerk for his trouble in making out the
same; which certificate shall bear date on the day
whereon it is issued, and remain in force from
thence until the first day of July then after, and
no longer. Such certificate may be demanded by
the <i>unqualified</i> as well as
<span class="smcap lowercase">QUALIFIED</span>; and if the
Clerk of the Peace shall refuse to grant such certificate
when demanded, he is liable to the penalty
of <span class="smcap lowercase">TWENTY POUNDS</span>.</p>

<p>Any person, qualified or unqualified, who shall
be in pursuit of game, without having obtained
such certificate, shall be liable to the penalty of
<span class="smcap lowercase">TWENTY POUNDS</span>. It is also provided in the said
Act, That every person having obtained a certificate,
who shall find <i>any other</i> person in pursuit of
game also, it shall be lawful for him (after having
produced his own certificate) to demand from such
other person, the certificate to him issued of having
conformed to the said Act; and on such demand,
such person shall produce such certificate, and permit
the same to be inspected; and on refusing to
produce the same, and also refusing to give his
<span class="smcap">Christian</span> and <span class="smcap">Surname</span>,
and place of residence,
or giving <i>a false name</i> or place of residence, he
shall forfeit the sum of <span class="smcap lowercase">FIFTY POUNDS</span>.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{317}</div>

<p>It is to be observed, that persons taking out
<span class="smcap lowercase">A CERTIFICATE</span>, who are <i>not qualified</i> by former
Acts to <span class="smcap lowercase">KILL GAME</span>, derive no privilege from their
certificate so to do; but, nevertheless, remain
liable to all the penalties of former acts, if informed
against, and prosecuted to conviction. It,
however, appears, upon the experience of the last
seven years, that since the privilege of killing game
has contributed so largely to the exigencies of the
State, less <i>litigation</i> has prevailed upon the score
of <span class="smcap lowercase">PRESERVATION</span>. Indeed, there is now so little
fear of an information, that almost every person
having taken out a certificate, erroneously considers
himself <i>nominally</i> entitled <span class="smcap lowercase">TO KILL</span>; in full
confirmation of which, the list of those who have
obtained certificates in the different counties, may
be inspected at the <span class="smcap">Stamp Office</span>, upon the payment
of <i>one shilling</i>, where will be found the names
of hundreds who do not individually possess an
independent <span class="smcap lowercase">TWENTY POUNDS</span> <i>per annum</i> upon the
face of <span class="smcap lowercase">THE GLOBE</span>.</p>

<p>In all cases where the penalty does not exceed
20<i>l</i>. the <span class="smcap">Justice</span> of
<span class="smcap">Peace</span> shall, upon information
or complaint, summon the party and witnesses to
appear, and proceed to hear and determine the
matter in a summary way; and, upon due proof,
by confession, or the <span class="smcap">oath</span> of <i>one</i> witness, give
judgment for the forfeiture; and issue his warrant
for levying the same on offenders goods, and to
<span class="pagenum">{318}</span>
sell them, if not redeemed within six days; rendering
to the party what overplus there may happen
to be; and if goods sufficient are not found to answer
the <span class="smcap lowercase">PENALTY</span>, the offender shall stand committed
<span class="smcap lowercase">TO PRISON</span> for <i>six calendar months</i>, unless
the penalty be sooner paid. Any offender feeling
himself aggrieved by such judgment, may, upon
giving security, amounting to the value of the forfeiture,
with the costs of affirmance, <span class="smcap lowercase">APPEAL</span> to the
next <span class="smcap">general Quarter Sessions</span>, when it is to be
heard and finally determined; and in case the
judgment be affirmed, Sessions may award such
costs incurred by appeal as to themselves shall seem
meet. <span class="smcap">Justices</span> may mitigate penalties; so that
the reasonable charges of officers and informers for
discovery and prosecution, be always allowed over
and above mitigation, and so as the same does not
reduce the penalty to less than a moiety, over and
above the costs and charges.</p>

<p>Restrictions for killing <span class="smcap lowercase">GAME</span> are as follow: No
<span class="smcap lowercase">PARTRIDGE</span> to be killed between the 12th of February
and 1st of September, under a penalty of
<span class="smcap lowercase">FIVE POUNDS</span>. No
<span class="smcap lowercase">PHEASANT</span> between the 1st of
February and 1st of October, under the like penalty.
<span class="smcap">Grouse</span>, or
<span class="smcap lowercase">RED GAME</span>, only from August
12th to December 10th. <span class="smcap">Heath fowl</span>, or
<span class="smcap lowercase">BLACK GAME</span>,
from August 20th to December 10th.
<span class="smcap">Bustards</span> from December 1st to March 1st. No
time is limited for the killing of <span class="smcap lowercase">HARES</span>, provided
<span class="pagenum">{319}</span>
they are not illegally taken. No <span class="smcap lowercase">GAME</span> whatever
is to be killed or <i>taken</i> sooner than
<span class="smcap lowercase">ONE HOUR</span> before
<span class="smcap lowercase">SUN RISING</span>, or later than
<span class="smcap lowercase">ONE HOUR</span> after
<span class="smcap lowercase">SUN SET</span>,
under a penalty of 5<i>l</i>. to the qualified or unqualified.
Killing game on <span class="smcap">Sunday</span>,
or <span class="smcap">Christmas-day</span>,
liable to the same penalty as killing game
during the night.</p>

<p>Any unqualified person exposing a
<span class="smcap lowercase">HARE</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">PHEASANT</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">PARTRIDGE</span>, or other game, to sale, is liable
to a penalty of 5<i>l</i>. For selling a
<span class="smcap lowercase">HARE</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">PHEASANT</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">PARTRIDGE</span>, or other game, qualified or unqualified,
5<i>l</i>. If either are found in the shop, house,
or possession of any <span class="smcap lowercase">POULTERER</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">SALESMAN</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">FISHMONGER</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">COOK</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">PASTRY-COOK</span>, or of any person
not qualified in his <i>own right</i> to
<span class="smcap lowercase">KILL GAME</span>, or entitled
thereto under some person so qualified, it
shall be deemed an exposing thereof to sale.</p>

<p>Unqualified persons <i>using</i> any <i>engine</i> to kill or
destroy <span class="smcap lowercase">HARES</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">PHEASANTS</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">PARTRIDGES</span>, or other
game, liable to a penalty of 5<i>l</i>. as well as <i>keeping</i>
and <i>using</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">GREYHOUNDS</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">SETTING DOGS</span>, or any
engines to kill or destroy <span class="smcap lowercase">HARES</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">PHEASANTS</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">PARTRIDGES</span>,
or other game, are liable to a penalty of
5<i>l</i>. The <i>keeping</i> or <i>using</i> being individually or
jointly liable to the forfeiture of 5<i>l</i>. as well as for
killing, so it should appear, from the plain construction
of the Acts, that if the informations
are <i>separately laid</i>, first for "<i>keeping</i> and <i>using</i>,"
<span class="pagenum">{320}</span>
and secondly "for <span class="smcap lowercase">KILLING</span>," conviction must
inevitably follow for both, if sufficient evidence is
produced to confirm the offence. Informations
must be laid within <span class="smcap lowercase">SIX CALENDAR MONTHS</span>, before
a <span class="smcap">Justice</span> of
<span class="smcap">Peace</span>, or by action of debt, bill,
plaint, or information. The whole penalty to be
given to the informer, with <i>double costs</i>, if brought
on in <span class="smcap">Westminster Hall</span>. Summary conviction,
half to the <i>informer</i>, and half to <i>the poor</i>. These
are the penalties annexed to former Acts, independent
of the Act respecting annual certificates to be
taken out from the <span class="smcap">Clerk</span> of the
<span class="smcap">Peace</span>, to <span class="smcap lowercase">KILL</span>
(or go in pursuit of) <span class="smcap lowercase">GAME</span>;
without which, incurs an <i>additional</i> penalty of 20<i>l</i>.
to the unqualified, making the forfeiture 25<i>l</i>. and of 20<i>l</i>. to the
<span class="smcap lowercase">QUALIFIED</span>, who becomes only liable to that single
penalty, for killing, or attempting to kill, game
without the annual certificate so prescribed to be
taken out.</p>

<p>A <span class="smcap lowercase">QUALIFIED PERSON</span> cannot come upon another
man's ground to <span class="smcap lowercase">KILL GAME</span>, without being liable
to an <span class="smcap lowercase">ACTION</span> for <i>trespass</i>; and an unqualified
person for trespassing, shall pay full costs: but if
a person qualified to kill game, sustains an <span class="smcap lowercase">ACTION</span>
for <i>trespass</i>, and the damage shall be found under
40<i>s</i>. he shall in such case pay no more
<span class="smcap lowercase">COSTS</span> than
<span class="smcap lowercase">DAMAGES</span>;
this being a most equitable construction,
to prevent paltry and personal litigations. It has
been decided by the highest legal authority, that
<span class="pagenum">{321}</span>
any unqualified person may go out to beat hedges,
bushes, and mark birds, in company with any qualified
person, to see the game pursued and taken,
without being liable to any penalty, provided he
has no <span class="smcap lowercase">DOG</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">GUN</span>, or
<span class="smcap lowercase">ENGINE</span>, of his own, individually,
to assist in its destruction.</p>

<p>It would be unfair to conclude this subject,
which has for centuries occasioned such a diversity
of opinions amongst the <span class="smcap lowercase">SUPERIOR CLASSES</span>, and
diffused so much discontent amongst the <i>lower</i>,
without submitting to <i>both</i>, a very
<span class="smcap lowercase">EMPHATIC</span> and
literal extract from <span class="smcap">Judge Blackstone</span>, in his
comment upon the Forest Laws, in which he has
this particular passage.</p>

<p>"From a simple principle, to which, though the
<span class="smcap">Forest Laws</span> are now mitigated, and by degrees
grown entirely obsolete, yet, from this root has
sprung a <i>bastard-slip</i>, known by the name of the
<span class="smcap">Game Laws</span>, now arrived to, and wantoning in,
its highest vigour; both founded upon the same
unreasonable notions of permanent property in
wild creatures, and productive of the same tyranny;
but with this difference, that the Forest Laws established
only one <span class="smcap lowercase">MIGHTY HUNTER</span> throughout the
land; the <span class="smcap">Game Laws</span> have raised a little
<span class="smcap">Nimrod</span> in every manor."</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">GAMES of ART</span></h3><p>—are those in which the
skill, judgment, and penetration of the player are
immediately concerned, and upon which alone his
success must entirely depend. In this class are included
<span class="smcap">Billiards</span>, <span class="smcap">Chess</span>,
<span class="smcap">Draughts</span>, <span class="smcap">Cricket</span>,
<span class="smcap">Fives</span>, <span class="smcap">Tennis</span>,
<span class="smcap">Bowls</span>, and some others, as well
as a few upon the <span class="smcap">Cards</span>; but as the latter are always
subject to <span class="smcap lowercase">DECEPTION</span>, and completely subservient
to the <i>slipping</i>, <i>sliding</i>, and <i>cutting</i> of the
most <span class="smcap lowercase">FAMILIAR FRIENDS</span>, (even in private families,)
they are, with propriety, much more entitled to
the appellation of <span class="smcap lowercase">CHANCE</span> than of
<span class="smcap lowercase">ART</span>, particularly
where the unsuspecting player has the <i>perpetual
chance</i> of being <span class="smcap lowercase">ROBBED</span>, without the mortification
of knowing the main-spring of depredation. However
expert those may be, who indulge and excel
in <span class="smcap lowercase">GAMES</span> of
<span class="smcap lowercase">ART</span>, two things should ever be predominant
in memory; always to play with an invariable
philosophic <span class="smcap lowercase">PATIENCE</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">SERENITY</span>, never
to seem affected by a temporary run of ill-luck or
momentary advantage, any more than agitated by
the exulting irritation of a successful opponent.
The run on one side may as suddenly be reversed
to the other; a chance that petulance and ill-humour
may probably destroy. <span class="smcap">Prudent players</span>
never engage in matches of any kind where <i>four</i> or
<i>more</i> are concerned, except amongst their most intimate
acquaintance; particularly at the public tables
of the Metropolis, where it is the custom for
<i>three</i> to poll <i>one</i>, and divide the spoils after the
<span class="pagenum">{323}</span>
<span class="smcap lowercase">PIDGEON</span> has been <i>plucked</i>; a very fashionable
mode of playing at both <span class="smcap lowercase">BILLIARDS</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">WHIST</span>;
by which an infinity of necessitous and unprincipled
adventurers procure a daily subsistence.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3><span class="smcap">GAMES of CHANCE</span></h3><p>.—Those games are so
called, which depend solely upon the turning up
of a <span class="smcap lowercase">CARD</span>, or the uncertain
"<span class="smcap lowercase">HAZARD</span> of
<span class="smcap lowercase">THE DIE</span>."
When fairly played, without any latent deception
on <i>one</i> side or the <i>other</i>, they are considered truly
equitable between the players, who are then said
"to <span class="smcap lowercase">PLAY UPON THE SQUARE</span>," without a point of
advantage, the whole being dependent upon, and
decided by, the <span class="smcap lowercase">EFFECT</span> of
<span class="smcap lowercase">CHANCE</span>. The celebrated
nocturnal game of <span class="smcap">Hazard</span>, at which such immense
property is annually <span class="smcap lowercase">LOST</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">WON</span>, at the most
fashionable and powerfully-supported
<span class="smcap lowercase">GAMING HOUSES</span>,
is known to be the first and fairest <span class="smcap lowercase">GAME</span>
of <span class="smcap lowercase">CHANCE</span>,
upon which an adventurer (determined
to encounter the probability of ruin) can possibly
venture to <span class="smcap lowercase">STAKE HIS MONEY</span>: on the contrary, it
must be admitted, that the torrent of villainy, and
unprincipled prostitution of <i>affected</i> integrity, have
made such rapid and unprecedented strides to perfection,
that the most experienced <span class="smcap lowercase">SPORTSMEN</span> must
despair of being enabled to <i>play upon the square</i>,
after so many <span class="smcap lowercase">GAMBLERS</span> of
<span class="smcap lowercase">FASHION</span> have, within a
few years, been detected with <i>loaded dice</i> in their
possession.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{324}</div>

<p>The game of E O, so plausibly deluding
to all classes, particularly to rustics upon the
different country <span class="smcap lowercase">COURSES</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">RACE GROUNDS</span>, is
the most <i>deceptive</i>, and most <i>destructive</i>, of any
ever yet displayed for the purpose of public attraction;
it may be very candidly placed in a parallel
line with those <i>low</i> and <i>rascally</i> inventions of
<span class="smcap lowercase">HUSTLING</span> in the
<span class="smcap lowercase">HAT</span>, and
<span class="smcap lowercase">PRICKING</span> in the
<span class="smcap lowercase">BELT</span>,
to both which an infinity of <i>cunning countrymen</i> become
infatuated dupes, to the great emolument and
gratification of that horde of miscreants, who subsist
only upon the credulity and ignorance of the
inexperienced, avaricious, and unsuspecting.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>GANGRENE</h3><p>—is a <i>technical</i> term, which in
<span class="smcap lowercase">FARRIERY</span>, as in <span class="smcap lowercase">SURGERY</span>, implies the first stage of
<span class="smcap lowercase">MORTIFICATION</span> or <span class="smcap lowercase">PUTREFACTION</span>.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3><span class="smcap">GASCOIN, or GASKIN</span></h3><p>,—of a horse, is that
part of the hind quarter extending from the stifle
(or inferior point of the thigh approaching the
belly) to the bend of the hock behind; upon the
shape, strength, and uniformity of which, the property,
action, and excellence of the horse very
much depends. If the <span class="smcap lowercase">GASKINS</span> are wide, and divide
below the tail in a curvilinear arch on the inside,
with a prominent swell of the muscle on the
outside, it is not only indicative of great strength,
but adds considerably to the symmetry and value
of the horse, when viewed behind. A horse well
<span class="pagenum">{325}</span>
formed in the gaskins, is seldom badly shaped in
the fore quarters; nor are they, in general, horses
of inferior action; exclusive of which, they are
insured from the very aukward <span class="smcap lowercase">DEFECT</span> of <i>cutting</i>;
no small inconvenience to a <span class="smcap lowercase">TRAVELLER</span> with a
<i>weary</i> horse upon a <i>long</i> journey.</p>

<h3>GATE-NET</h3><p>.—A <span class="smcap lowercase">GATE-NET</span> is a principal part
of the <i>stock in trade</i> of an expert and experienced
<span class="smcap lowercase">POACHER</span>; and, in respect to
<span class="smcap lowercase">HARES</span>, the most destructive
nocturnal instrument that can be brought
into use. They, at a certain hour in the dead of
night, when hares are sure to be at feed, are fixed
to the third bar of the gates of such fields as have
<i>green wheat</i>, <i>young clover</i>, or any other where
(by daily observation) they are known to use;
when being fattened to the ground under the lower
bar by means of wooden forked pegs, <i>a lurcher</i> is
turned over the gate, who having been trained to
the business, and <i>running mute</i>, scours the field in
a circuitous direction; when the <i>victims</i>, thus suddenly
and unexpectedly alarmed, make immediately
for the gate, (by which they entered,) when
the dog being close at their heels, at least not far
behind them, they have no alternative, but to rush
into the net, where becoming entangled, they meet
their destruction. In this way <i>three</i> or <i>four brace</i>
are taken in a plentiful country at one adventure.
The only likely mode of rendering such attempts
<i>abortive</i>, is by painting the lower bars of the gate

<h3>GAZEHOUND</h3><p>;—the name by which the species
of <span class="smcap lowercase">DOG</span> we now term
<span class="smcap lowercase">GREYHOUND</span> was formerly
called. With what propriety an animal of almost
<i>every colour</i> should be equally denominated <i>grey</i>,
does not appear; any more than at what particular
period the change in appellation may have taken
place. As the pursuit of the <span class="smcap lowercase">GREYHOUND</span> is entirely
by <i>sight</i>, and not by <i>scent</i>, it should seem that
<span class="smcap lowercase">GAZEHOUND</span> would be the most proper distinction of
the two, and that the present is no more than a
perversion from the original.</p>

<h3>GELDING</h3><p>—implies a horse divested of his
<span class="smcap lowercase">TESTICLES</span>, by which he is deprived of the act of
<span class="smcap lowercase">COPULATION</span>, and of farther
<span class="smcap lowercase">PROPAGATION</span>. For

<h3><span class="smcap">GIFT of GOING</span></h3><p>—is a phrase from the sublime
vocabulary of the horse-dealing fraternity,
and implies a horse's possessing a much greater
portion of <i>speed</i> in <i>action</i>, particularly in
<span class="smcap lowercase">TROTTING</span>,
than could well be expected from his shape and external
<span class="pagenum">{327}</span>
appearance. When a horse is shewn for
sale, having little to recommend him, rough in his
coat, low in condition, aukward in shape, and
without a single <i>point</i> of <i>attraction</i>, if he can scramble
along at the rate of twelve or thirteen miles an
hour, he is then said to possess the "gift of going,"
which is to compensate for every other deficiency.</p>

<h3>GIMCRACK</h3><p>,—the name of a horse who was of
great celebrity upon the turf, and for two or three
years beat most of his time. He was foaled in
1760; got by <span class="smcap">Cripple</span>, (a son of the Godolphin
Arabian;) dam by <span class="smcap">Grisewood's</span> <i>Partner</i>, and his
pedigree was of the best blood; but being too small
for a stallion of eminence, produced no winners of
note. He was followed by <span class="smcap">young Gimcrack</span>, a
good horse for <span class="smcap lowercase">GIVE</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">TAKE PLATES</span>, particularly
at four heats.</p>

<h3>GINGER</h3><p>—is an aromatic spicy root, brought
to us from the <span class="smcap">East</span> and
<span class="smcap">West Indies</span>, in a preserved
as well as in its natural state. In the former
it is used as a stomachic and sweetmeat by the superior
orders: in the latter it is common in all the
shops, consisting of flat-knotted branches, of which
the whitest, and least stringy or fibrous, are the
best. It is a very useful ingredient in many compositions
for the internal diseases of horses, particularly
in the <span class="smcap lowercase">FLATULENT CHOLIC</span>, commonly called
<span class="smcap lowercase">FRET</span>. Houses in the country, remote from towns,
<span class="pagenum">{328}</span>
where horses are used and fed upon peas haum,
and other winter fodder, frequently producing such
disorders, should never be without a small quantity
of this article: two ounces bruised, and boiled in
<span class="smcap lowercase">ALE</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">GRUEL</span>, then drained off, and the liquor
given with a horn, would prove an excellent substitute
for medicine upon many emergencies.</p>

<h3>GIGS</h3><p>;—a term almost obsolete for what are
now called <span class="smcap lowercase">FLAPS</span>,
a kind of flaccid fleshy enlargement
on each side a horse's jaw, which, in his
mastication, frequently falling between the grinders,
is productive of pain, and prevents the horse from
eating. If they are long and thin, they may be
completely taken off by a pair of scissars, and the
wounds washed with a strong solution of alum in
water: if they are too fleshy and substantial for this
mode of extirpation, they may be slightly scarified
with a <span class="smcap lowercase">BISTORY</span>, or
<span class="smcap lowercase">ABSCESS LANCET</span>, and after
having been left to bleed for a proper length of
time, may be stopped, and the parts constringed by
the solution already described.</p>

<h3>GIRTHS</h3><p>—are those well-known articles made
from woollen web, and used for keeping the saddle
in a safe and proper position. These, to prevent
<span class="smcap lowercase">GALLING</span>, should be made of
<span class="smcap lowercase">ELASTIC</span>, and not the
<i>tight</i> wove web, which being more <i>rigid</i> and <i>harsh</i>,
is the more likely to <span class="smcap lowercase">LACERATE</span>
during the <i>heat</i> and
<i>friction</i> of a long chase. Observation should be
<span class="pagenum">{329}</span>
made that girths are never too short, so as to have
the buckle below the pad of the saddle, either on
one side or the other; for want of which judicious
and sportsman-like attention, <span class="smcap lowercase">WARBLES</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">SITFASTS</span>,
and <span class="smcap lowercase">WOUNDS</span>, very frequently ensue.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">GIVE and TAKE PLATES</span></h3><p>—are those where
the <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSES</span> carry
<span class="smcap lowercase">WEIGHT</span> according to their
<span class="smcap lowercase">HEIGHT</span>,
by the regulated standard of <i>four inches</i> to a
<span class="smcap lowercase">HAND</span>.
The fixed rules for a <span class="smcap lowercase">GIVE</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">TAKE</span> are, that horses
measuring <span class="smcap lowercase">FOURTEEN HANDS</span>, are each to carry nine
stone; above or below which height, they are to
carry seven pounds, <i>more</i> or <i>less</i>, for <i>every inch</i> they
are <span class="smcap lowercase">HIGHER</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">LOWER</span> than the
<span class="smcap lowercase">FOURTEEN HANDS</span>
fixed as the criterion.—Example: a horse measuring
<span class="smcap lowercase">FOURTEEN HANDS</span>, <i>one inch and a half</i>, will
carry nine stone, ten pounds, eight ounces; a
horse measuring <span class="smcap lowercase">THIRTEEN HANDS</span>,
<i>two inches and a
half</i>, will carry only eight stone, three pounds,
eight ounces; the former being one inch and a half
above the <span class="smcap lowercase">FOURTEEN HANDS</span>,
the other one inch and
a half below it. The weight is, therefore, added,
or diminished, by the eighths of every inch, higher
or lower weight in proportion; and these
<span class="smcap lowercase">PLATES</span>
were so exceedingly popular some few years since,
that very few country courses were without one of
this description.</p>

<h3>GLANDERS</h3><p>—is, perhaps, without exception,
the most dreadful, and certainly destructive, disease
<span class="pagenum">{330}</span>
to which the horse is incident. No exertions have
been wanting on the part of the most eminent professional
men (particularly in France) to discover
the means of successfully counteracting the justly-dreaded
virulence of this disorder; but hitherto
with so little the appearance of progress, that it is
almost an invariable custom to render the subject
an immediate <span class="smcap lowercase">VICTIM</span> to
<span class="smcap lowercase">DEATH</span>, so soon as he is
ascertained to have become the <span class="smcap lowercase">VICTIM</span> of
<span class="smcap lowercase">DISEASE</span>.
There are never wanting <span class="smcap lowercase">SPECULATORS</span>, or
<span class="smcap lowercase">SPECULATIVE WRITERS</span>,
so long as "a doubt remains to
hang a loop upon;" and many of these both <i>speak</i>
and <i>write</i> as prompted by their <i>pecuniary</i> sensations,
and the sale of the <span class="smcap lowercase">NOSTRUM</span>
it is their personal interest
to promote. These, of course, promulgate
not the probability, but the <i>certainty</i>, of <i>cure</i>, and
may, in so doing, possibly prey upon the credulity
of those who are equally strangers to the origin of
this disease, its progress, its effects, or its termination.</p>

</div>

<p>After the great variety of opinions which have
taken place; after all the investigations made by
every class of the most diligent inquirers in anatomical
dissections, as well as by various other means,
three facts are incontrovertibly established: first,
that the disease is <span class="smcap lowercase">INFECTIOUS</span>;
secondly, that it is
<span class="smcap lowercase">CURABLE</span>; and lastly,
that the <span class="smcap lowercase">LUNGS</span> of every
<span class="smcap lowercase">HORSE</span> <i>dying</i> under the
<i>disorder</i>, or <i>killed</i> during <i>its
progress</i>, have been either partially, or totally,
<span class="pagenum">{331}</span>
destroyed. This demonstrated beyond the power
of contradiction, what does it prove? Why, very
clearly, to the judicious and scientific, who are inquisitive
to experience, and open to conviction,
that this disorder is in direct affinity to the
<span class="smcap lowercase">PULMONARY CONSUMPTION</span>
of the <span class="smcap lowercase">HUMAN SPECIES</span>; but
that the horse having no means of throwing off the
morbid matter by <i>expectoration</i>, as is the case with
us, <span class="smcap">Nature</span>, in her strong and inexplicable efforts
for relief, propels the putrid discharge through the
nostrils of the animal; whereas with the
<span class="smcap lowercase">HUMAN FRAME</span>,
the <i>wasting</i> of the <i>lungs</i> passes through, and
is discharged by, the mouth; and this, to the experienced
practitioner, and learned inquirer, will
hold forth the most unequivocal and satisfactory
proof, that the <span class="smcap lowercase">GLANDERS</span> is a virulent
<span class="smcap lowercase">CONSUMPTION</span>
of <span class="smcap lowercase">THE LUNGS</span>,
by the <i>corrosive</i> property of which
discharge (become inveterate) the glandular passages
are proportionally affected.</p>

<p>Much judicious observation, and professional
knowledge, is requisite to discriminate between this
disease, and others bearing <i>a part</i> of its <i>appearances</i>:
many horses are too hastily deemed <span class="smcap lowercase">GLANDERED</span>,
which are <i>not so</i>; and others as ignorantly said to
be labouring under <span class="smcap lowercase">A COLD</span>,
and its <i>consequence</i>, till
a whole stable has been affected, and every horse
lost. The distinguishing traits are a discharge from
one or both nostrils, of a viscid, slimy, and fœtid
matter, having a kind of greasy tinge upon the surface:
<span class="pagenum">{332}</span>
it is glutinous in its property, hanging to,
and becoming dry and barky, upon the internal
edges of the nostrils: it is white at the beginning,
and grows darker in proportion to the duration and
inveteracy of the disease; it becomes yellow, ash-colour,
green, and lastly, tinged with blood, at
which time, as well as before, it is dreadfully offensive:
previous to this stage, indurated tumefactions
have taken place under the jaws, the frame
is daily more and more emaciated, the eyes sink
gradually in their orbits, the appetite totally ceases,
the body becomes almost motionless, seeming a
mere lifeless trunk, till it falls to the ground a mass
of perfect putrefaction.</p>

<h3>GNAWPOST</h3><p>—was a country <span class="smcap lowercase">PLATE HORSE</span> of
some celebrity, winning several for some years in
succession. He was bred by <span class="smcap">Mr. Shaftoe</span>; was
foaled in 1767; and got by <span class="smcap">Snap</span> out of <i>Miss
Cranbourne</i>, who was got by the Godolphin Arabian,

<h3>GOLDFINDER</h3><p>;—the name of one of the
molt valuable and successful horses ever bred or
trained in this kingdom: he beat nearly every
horse of his time, and won almost every stakes he
started for. He was bred by <span class="smcap">Mr. Shaftoe</span>; foaled
in 1764; got by <span class="smcap">Snap</span>;
dam by <span class="smcap">Blank</span>; grand-dam
by <span class="smcap">Regulus</span>, and the six preceding generations
<span class="pagenum">{333}</span>
by <span class="smcap">Arabians</span>, <span class="smcap">Barbs</span>,

covered before his time in this kingdom. His progeny
became equally eminent as stallions, to the
whole of which are we principally indebted for the
unprecedented eminence and superiority of the various
studs so plentifully established in different
parts of the country. He was the sire of <i>Cade</i>, <i>Regulus</i>,

<h3>"GONE AWAY!"</h3><p>—is the exhilarating communicative
<span class="smcap lowercase">HOLLOA</span>! from one sportsman to
another in <span class="smcap lowercase">STAG</span> or <span class="smcap lowercase">FOX</span> hunting, when the game
breaks from large coverts, and <i>goes away</i>; at which
time, if it was not for this friendly rule, invariably
observed, those who happen to be <i>up the wind</i>,
would be inevitably <i>thrown out</i>, and the hounds
have got miles, before the most distant part of the
field knew any thing of the matter. To prevent
the mortifying probability of which, those nearest
the chace and the hounds, instantly vociferate the
enlivening signal of, "<span class="smcap lowercase">GONE AWAY</span>!". This being
repeated by the <i>next</i> in succession, it is re-echoed
by <i>a third</i>, and so on till it vibrates through the
<span class="pagenum">{334}</span>
whole chain; and it must be acknowledged, there
is not a more gratifying moment in the progress of
a chase, than to see the distant effort of every individual,
to recover his lost ground, and get in with
the hounds.</p>

<h3>GORGED</h3><p>;—the common and vulgar term for
swelled legs, when their enlarged and distended
state has been occasioned more by <i>severe</i> and <i>hard</i>
work, than the effect of <span class="smcap lowercase">HUMOURS</span> originating in a
fizey or morbid state of the blood. A horse having
his back sinews flushed, and legs thickened, so as
to go short and stiff in action, but not <i>broken down</i>,
is said to be <i>gorged</i>. Having the same appearances
from humours, or a viscidity of the blood, he is
then said to be <i>foul</i>, and must be relieved by
<span class="smcap lowercase">PURGATIVES</span>
or <span class="smcap lowercase">DIURETICS</span>, assisted by a great deal of
hand-rubbing and regular friction. Gorged horses
should be blistered, and turned out in time, by
which they frequently get <i>fresh again</i>: continued
at work too long, they <i>break down</i>, and become
cripples.</p>

<h3>GOULARD</h3><p>.—The article so well known by
this name, and so constantly brought into use upon
many emergencies, is the <span class="smcap lowercase">EXTRACT</span> of
<span class="smcap lowercase">LEAD</span>; which
is prepared by, and may be obtained of, almost
every druggist in the kingdom. Its excellent properties
are universally admitted as a <span class="smcap lowercase">CORROBORANT</span>,
a <span class="smcap lowercase">REPELLENT</span>, a
<span class="smcap lowercase">SOLVENT</span>, and an almost infallible
<span class="pagenum">{335}</span>
remedy in well-proportioned topical applications to
<i>inflammations</i>, <i>strains</i>, <i>bruises</i>, or <i>recent tumefactions</i>:
but some degree of professional knowledge,
and experimental practice, is necessary to insure a
probable certainty of effect. Upon the first discovery
of this article, it was brought into use in <i>very small</i>
quantities, and a teaspoonful or two only were directed
to be added to a quart of spring water, which
was then termed <i>Vegeto Mineral Water</i>, and in certain
cases (particularly of the eyes) looked up to as
<span class="smcap lowercase">A SPECIFIC</span>. Long experience,
and attentive observation,
have, however, justified its utility in
<i>much larger</i> proportions, particularly with
<span class="smcap lowercase">HORSES</span>;
where, in severe strains, or long-standing lamenesses,
less than <i>four ounces</i> to a pint of
<span class="smcap lowercase">CAMPHORATED</span>
spirits cannot be brought into use with any
expectation of success.——As a mild repellent to
<span class="smcap lowercase">SWELLINGS</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">BRUISES</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">WARBLES</span>, &amp;c. two ounces of
the extract, two ounces of camphorated spirits,
and a pint of water, will be a proper proportion.
In defluxions and inflammation of the eyes, one
ounce of each, with a pint and half of water, will
be found a very useful composition.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>GOURDINESS</h3><p>—is another rustic or provincial
term for <span class="smcap lowercase">SWELLED LEGS</span>, but of a different
description, implying the kind of <i>dropsical laxity</i>
of the <span class="smcap lowercase">SOLIDS</span>, submitting to pressure,
and recovering
from its indentation when the pressure is removed.
This kind of swelling is a gradual approach
<span class="pagenum">{336}</span>
to the disorder called <span class="smcap lowercase">GREASE</span>, at which it
will soon arrive, if not counteracted speedily, by
such <span class="smcap lowercase">EVACUANTS</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">ALTERATIVES</span> as may be
thought most applicable to the case.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>GRASS</h3><p>—is that well-known produce of the
earth, which is the proper food for horses in a state
of <span class="smcap lowercase">NATURE</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">EASE</span>, and
<span class="smcap lowercase">INDOLENCE</span>; but not of sufficient
nutritive property for horses engaged in either
<span class="smcap lowercase">SEVERE</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">LABORIOUS</span>, or
<span class="smcap lowercase">ACTIVE</span> exertions. Horses
taken up from grass, and put suddenly to work, labour
under an immediate and perceptible disquietude;
the contents of the intestines are soon evacuated
in a <span class="smcap lowercase">STATE</span> of
<span class="smcap lowercase">LAXITY</span>, the frame displays a
profusion of <span class="smcap lowercase">FOUL</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">FŒTID PERSPIRATION</span>, the
body bespeaks its own <span class="smcap lowercase">DEBILITY</span>,
and the perseverance
of a few days demonstrates its <span class="smcap lowercase">EMACIATION</span>.
To horses having been whole months in constant
use and work, alternately accustomed to diurnal
drudgery, and the routine of the manger,
<span class="smcap lowercase">GRASS</span>,
with its conjunctive <span class="smcap lowercase">LIBERTY</span>,
must prove a sweet,
a comfortable, a proper, and a healthy change: it
not only, by its own attenuating property, proportionally
alters the <span class="smcap lowercase">PROPERTY</span> of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">BLOOD</span>, but
affords, by the comforts of <span class="smcap lowercase">EASE</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">EXPANSION</span>,
a renovation of elasticity and vigour to the relaxed
sinews, the exhausted spirits, and the battered
frame.</p>

</div>

<div class="pagenum">{337}</div>

<p>To the penurious and the unfeeling (equally insensible)
it is sufficient, that a horse, worn to the
bone with <i>constant work</i>, and <i>want</i> of <i>food</i>, is
"<span class="smcap lowercase">TURNED TO GRASS</span>" in the winter, when there is
<i>none to be eaten</i>; or during the months of <span class="smcap">July</span> and
<span class="smcap">August</span>, when a horse loses more
<span class="smcap lowercase">FLESH</span> by persecution
from <i>flies</i> (if not well protected by shade,
accommodated with plenty of water, and an equal
plenty of grass) than he can acquire by any advantage
arising from <span class="smcap lowercase">LIBERTY</span> alone;
which some people
seem to conceive all that is required, and that
the poor animal, <span class="smcap">Camelion</span> like, "can live upon
the air." It should be recollected, that in the animal
œconomy, substance only can beget substance,
(see <span class="smcap">Aliment</span>;) and no horse will be likely to accumulate
flesh, or become <span class="smcap lowercase">FAT</span>, whose means of
living are <i>poor</i>.</p>

<p>Impoverished rushy moors, and lank half-rotten
autumn grass, (particularly after <i>wet</i> summers,)
will prove much more likely to produce <span class="smcap lowercase">DISEASE</span>,
than produce <span class="smcap lowercase">CONDITION</span>. Those who turn out
horses to grass with a cough upon them, particularly
if from a <span class="smcap lowercase">WARM STABLE</span> in a <i>cold season</i>,
may expect to take them up with a short, husky, laboured
asthmatic increase of the original complaint,
or with tubercles formed upon the lungs; and those
who <i>turn out</i> in the winter season, with a hope of
obtaining the cure of <span class="smcap lowercase">CRACKED HEELS</span>, or
<span class="smcap lowercase">SWELLED LEGS</span>,
may probably <i>take up</i> with a confirmed
<span class="pagenum">{338}</span>
<span class="smcap lowercase">GREASE</span>, particularly if the constitution
should lean
a little to <i>blood</i>, and <i>pedigree</i> of that description.</p>

<p>The utility and advantages of physic were never
better understood, or more clearly ascertained, than
at the present moment of general improvement:
experienced sportsmen, and rational observers,
however doubtful they may have been, are now
convinced of its propriety, and never deviate from
its practice. They invariably <i>cleanse</i> at the <i>end</i> of
the <span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTING SEASON</span>, and repeat the ceremony
<i>after</i> taking their horses up from grass, previous to
getting them into condition. Let those who doubt
the consistency, try the experiment, and they will
be soon convinced, how little <i>one</i> will be enabled
to stand a <span class="smcap lowercase">WINTER'S WORK</span> with the
<i>other</i>.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>GRAVELLED</h3><p>.—A horse is said, by the lower
classes, to be <span class="smcap lowercase">GRAVELLED</span>,
when broken particles of
<i>flints</i>, or small <i>pebbles</i>, are insinuated between the
outer <span class="smcap lowercase">SOLE</span> of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">FOOT</span> and the
<span class="smcap lowercase">WEB</span> of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">SHOE</span>.
This injury is seldom sustained, but where the shoe
is formed <i>too flat</i> upon the <i>inner surface</i>, (without
its proper protecting concavity,) when pressing too
close, whatever extraneous substance gains admission,
is there confined, and, from the stricture,
has no possible chance of extrication. The degree
of pain, or tenderness, depends entirely upon the
mildness or severity of the case, and the length of
its duration. The road to relief is the same; the
<span class="pagenum">{339}</span>
shoe should be tenderly taken off, by one nail at a
time, in preference to tearing it off by main and
sudden force, (according to custom;) the sole
should be well fomented with good hot milk and
water, then covered with an <span class="smcap lowercase">EMOLLIENT POULTICE</span>
of linseed powder, milk, and two table spoonsful
of olive oil, letting the same be repeated daily, till
the inflammation has subsided, and the tenderness
gone off; when the bottom of the hoof may be
hardened by <i>two</i> or <i>three</i> applications of a sponge
dipt in vinegar <i>boiling hot</i> before
<span class="smcap lowercase">THE SHOE</span> is replaced.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>GREASE</h3><p>.—The <span class="smcap lowercase">GREASE</span>
is a disorder particularly
affecting the <span class="smcap lowercase">CART</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">DRAFT HORSES</span> of this
country, but is seldom or rarely observed amongst
horses of a superior description: its seat is cutaneous,
and it first discovers itself by a stagnation of
the fluids, and as consequent inflammatory enlargement
above and about the fetlock, attended with
pain and stiffness, <i>more</i> or <i>less</i>, according to the
state of the subject, or the severity of the attack.
If proper means are not immediately taken, and
judiciously persevered in, a degree of virulence,
much trouble, and tedious attendance, unavoidably
ensue. The skin, by its preternatural distension,
soon assumes a greasy kind of transparency, having
an irregular scaly appearance upon the surface,
from whence (particularly when put into action)
exudes a thin oily <span class="smcap lowercase">ICHOR</span>, which, when become of
<span class="pagenum">{340}</span>
long duration, is frequently tinged
<span class="smcap lowercase">WITH BLOOD</span>,
but always of a <i>filthy unctuous</i> property, and <i>greasy</i>
to the <i>touch</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>As it advances in unrestrained progress, it increases
the growth of the hoof around <span class="smcap lowercase">THE CORONET</span>,
rendering it of a <i>soft</i>, <i>spongy</i>, and <i>diseased</i> appearance:
by the corrosive and fœtid property of the
discharge, it soon affects and putrifies
<span class="smcap lowercase">THE FROG</span>,
which it centrically <i>corrodes</i>, and lays the foundation
of <span class="smcap lowercase">CANKER</span> in the
<span class="smcap lowercase">FOOT</span>. As it becomes more
inveterate, so it proportionally extends itself, and
affects the surrounding parts; the small apertures
from whence the ferous ichor originally oozed,
now become malignant <span class="smcap lowercase">ULCERS</span>, intersected by
warty excrescences, and watery bladders of a <i>poisonous</i>
appearance. Arrived by length of time, want
of care, and probably by the use of improper medicines,
or injudicious treatment, at this its second
stage, it assumes a more formidable appearance,
and every symptom, as well as the limb, continues
to increase: what were before only <span class="smcap lowercase">CADAVEROUS ULCERS</span>,
now become (in a partial degree) <i>barky
eschars</i>, intermixed with <i>growing tetters</i>, from
amidst which trickles down, in smoaking heat, the
acrimonious sanies, or corrupted matter, which
seems to excoriate as it passes, and soon deprives
the part of hair; the little that is left serving only
as so many conductors, from whence flows in
streams the morbid matter, now become so truly
<span class="pagenum">{341}</span>
offensive, that a horse, in such state, should be separated
from others, lest fumes so incredibly noxious
should, from the miasma, lay the foundation
of disease with horses perfectly sound.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap lowercase">GREASE</span> may originate in either an
<span class="smcap lowercase">INTERNAL</span>
or an <span class="smcap">external</span> cause; as well as be transmitted by
hereditary taint (of <span class="smcap lowercase">SIRE</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">DAM</span>) from one generation
to another. An impure and acrimonious state
of the blood, unattended to till it has acquired
morbid malignity, must display itself in some part;
and with horses of the kind described, it generally
appears in the extremities, where the <span class="smcap lowercase">CIRCULATION</span>
is <i>languid</i>, and the <i>least able</i> to make
<span class="smcap lowercase">RESISTANCE</span>.
Horses too long continued in <span class="smcap lowercase">MOORS</span>
of long <i>lanky</i>
grass, intermixed with rushes, or in <span class="smcap lowercase">MARSHY MEADOWS</span>
of a <i>swampy</i> soil, where, in the dreary
months of <span class="smcap">autumn</span> and <span class="smcap lowercase">WINTER</span>,
their heels are
<i>never dry</i> for <i>weeks together</i>, is a very probable
foundation of permanent <span class="smcap lowercase">GREASE</span>,
or some other
<span class="smcap lowercase">CHRONIC</span> complaint,
the original cause of which is
<i>seldom</i> adverted to, perhaps <i>never</i> recollected. Cutaneous
disorders not properly eradicated by <span class="smcap lowercase">MERCURIALS</span>
or <span class="smcap lowercase">ANTIMONIALS</span>, but injudiciously thrown
upon the circulation by <span class="smcap lowercase">REPELLENTS</span>; the sudden
absorption of a plentiful flow of milk, when a colt
is taken from the dam; an extreme plethora, with
a fizey viscidity of the blood; or any of those
causes which too much relax the texture of
<span class="smcap lowercase">THE SOLIDS</span>,
or impoverish and stagnate <span class="smcap lowercase">THE FLUIDS</span>,
<span class="pagenum">{342}</span>
may be more immediately or remotely productive
of this disease.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">External causes</span> also frequently give rise to its
appearance; a sudden check to perspiration by
change of weather, or change of situation, from
one stable to another; or from either to the external
air, by turning out to grass from a warm and
comfortable stable, unfavourably followed by a
succession of cold nights, bleak winds, and rainy
weather; washing the heels in hard well water
after profuse perspiration; standing too constantly
upon stale and filthy dung, for days and nights, impregnated
with urine, so evidently prejudicial to
the feet and frogs. Horses fed upon grains are remarked
to be much subject to the disorder in a
slight degree, and this tendency is probably strengthened
by a want of cleanly attention, or a little assistance
from medicinal counteraction.</p>

<p>Much mischief is frequently occasioned by the
rash and injudicious interposition of some illiterate
practitioner, who, with a degree of <i>self-cunning</i>,
(peculiar to professional ignorance,) piques himself
upon the superiority of his art, and confidently proceeds
to oppose the predominant efforts which <span class="smcap">Nature</span>
has been induced to make for her <span class="smcap lowercase">OWN RELIEF</span>.
Influenced by the deceptive impression of <i>imaginary</i>
success, he begins with mild <i>repellents</i>, drying
<i>washes</i>, sharp <i>waters</i>, strong <i>astringents</i>, then <i>styptics</i>,
<span class="pagenum">{343}</span>
and lastly <span class="smcap lowercase">MERCURIAL</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">VITRIOLIC</span> <i>caustics</i>
and <i>escharotics</i>, where having reached the utmost
extent of his fertile faculties, he is <i>surprized</i>, but
not <span class="smcap lowercase">MORTIFIED</span>, at finding what he erroneously
thought a <i>remedy</i> has proved
<span class="smcap lowercase">TEN TIMES WORSE</span> than
the original disease. The Grease, upon its first
appearance, is, by a proper course of medicine,
and judicious management, very easily subdued,
and radically cured. In its second stage, great
<span class="smcap lowercase">PATIENCE</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">PERSEVERANCE</span> is required; and no
expence should be spared, or necessary means
omitted. In the third and last,
<span class="smcap lowercase">DEATH</span> is preferable to any attempt at cure.</p>

<h3>GREY</h3><p>.—The <span class="smcap lowercase">COLOUR</span> of a
<span class="smcap lowercase">HORSE</span> is so called,
where dark-coloured or <span class="smcap lowercase">BLACK</span> hairs are proportionally
intermixed with <span class="smcap lowercase">WHITE</span>: some of those are
beautifully mottled upon the rump, down the hind
quarters, and across the gaskins, and are then called
<span class="smcap lowercase">DAPPLED GREYS</span>. It is admitted by the old proverb,
and verified by all opinions, that "a <span class="smcap lowercase">GOOD</span> horse
can never be of a <span class="smcap lowercase">BAD</span> colour:" there is, however,
an exception to the adage, in a white or a light
grey; for, by laying down with the hind quarter,
on one side or the other, in the dung newly fallen,
it is no uncommon thing to have a daily <i>washing</i>,
and <i>drying</i>, before a horse of such colour can be
taken out of the stable either to
<span class="smcap lowercase">WORK</span> or to
<span class="smcap lowercase">EXERCISE</span>.</p>

<h3>GREYHOUND</h3><p>.—The particular species of
<span class="smcap lowercase">DOG</span> passing under the denomination of
<span class="smcap">greyhound</span>,
was formerly called <span class="smcap lowercase">GAZEHOUND</span>, and is at the
present day more universally known by the appellation
of <span class="smcap lowercase">LONG DOG</span> in many parts of the kingdom.
The breed has been at all times carefully cultivated
by the lovers of coursing, but has never been
brought to so great a degree of enthusiastic perfection,
as since the establishment of the different
<span class="smcap lowercase">COURSING CLUBS</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">SOCIETIES</span> in Norfolk, Essex,
Berkshire, and the Flixton Wolds of Yorkshire.
The members of each have, with an unremitting
perseverance, endeavoured to excel each other
with an unalloyed spice of <span class="smcap lowercase">SPORTING EMULATION</span>:
the late <span class="smcap">Lord Orford</span>; the
<span class="smcap">Marquis</span> of <span class="smcap">Townsend</span>;
<span class="smcap">Colonel Thornton</span>, of Thornville Royal;
<span class="smcap">Major Topham</span>, of the Wolds, and the <i>Reverend</i>
<span class="smcap">H. Bate Dudley</span>, of the Bradwell and Tillingham
Club, in Essex, are those who have excelled every
competitor, and improved the breed to the highest
possible state of perfection.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Czarina</i> was bred by the late <span class="smcap">Lord Orford</span>;
<i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Claret</i>, by <span class="smcap">Colonel Thornton</span>;
<i>Snowball</i>, by <span class="smcap">Major Topham</span>; <i>Miller</i>, by the
Reverend <span class="smcap">H. B. Dudley</span>; and <i>Schoolboy</i>, by the
celebrated <span class="smcap">Mr.</span> (Vauxhall)
<span class="smcap">Clarke</span>. Czarina, the
grand-dam of Snowball, was purchased at the late
Lord Orford's sale by Colonel Thornton, with an
intent to improve the breed, in which he was not
<span class="pagenum">{345}</span>
disappointed. She won <span class="smcap lowercase">FORTY-SEVEN</span> matches in
Norfolk, Wiltshire, and Yorkshire, and <i>never</i> was
beat. She displayed no signs of producing progeny
till <i>thirteen years old</i>, when she brought forth
<i>eight whelps</i>, got by <i>Jupiter</i>, who all lived, and
ran in high form.</p>

<p><i>Snowball</i> was got by <i>Claret</i>, (one of the eight
whelps of Czarina,) and supposed to be, taken
"for all in all," the surest dog to <i>kill</i> and <i>take up</i>
that ever ran. He won <span class="smcap lowercase">FOUR CUPS</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">COUPLES</span>, and
upwards of thirty matches; one of which was so
severe, that his opponent (a dog of <span class="smcap">Mr. Plumer's</span>)
died immediately after the course. <i>Claret</i> was got
by young <i>Jupiter</i>, out of old <i>Czarina</i>; he challenged
all Yorkshire, which was twice accepted; one
match he won; and received forfeit for the other.</p>

<p>That truly celebrated dog, the <i>Miller</i>, was
so large, awkward, and clumsey, when a puppy,
that he had been nearly thrown aside, and not
thought worthy of being brought into the field;
but a friend of Mr. Dudley's having borrowed him,
took him to the Marshes at St. Osyth, where, at
only twelve months old, he won several matches in
one day against the best dogs in the field. Having
thus accidentally <i>ran</i> himself into <i>reputation</i>, he
was, at his return, introduced to more powerful,
at least more <i>popular</i>, opponents, where, however,
he for <span class="smcap lowercase">SEVEN YEARS</span> maintained his superiority,
during <span class="smcap lowercase">SEVENTY-FOUR</span> successive
<span class="smcap lowercase">MATCHES</span>, without
<span class="pagenum">{346}</span>
having been beaten. He is at present a stallion in
great estimation, as all the stock he has yet produced
are excellent runners.</p>

<p><i>Schoolboy</i> was of great celebrity; he was bred by
<span class="smcap">Sir C. Bunbury</span>, and got by Dr. Frampton's <i>Fop</i>,
out of Sir Charles's <i>Miss</i>: he ran a great number
of <span class="smcap lowercase">MATCHES</span> for very considerable sums, particularly
over <span class="smcap">Newmarket</span>, and <i>never</i> was <i>beat</i>. Several of
his get have been sold for twenty guineas each, as
<i>Troy</i>, <i>Traveller</i>, and <i>Lilly</i>; all very good runners.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Daniel</span>, who, in his
"<span class="smcap">Rural Sports</span>,"
has given most beautiful and admirably executed
portraits of <i>Czarina</i>, <i>Maria</i>, <i>Venus</i>, and <i>Claret</i>,
engraved by Scott, has also introduced the following,
as a criterion of comparative speed between
the race-horse and the greyhound. "A match was
to have been run over Doncaster course, in the
December of 1800, for one hundred guineas; but
one of the horses having been drawn, a mare started
alone, to make good the bet, and, after having
gone the distance of about a mile, a greyhound
bitch started from the side of the course, and ran
with her the other three miles, keeping nearly head
to head, which produced a singular race; and when
they reached the distance post, five to four was
betted on the <span class="smcap lowercase">GREYHOUND</span>; when they came to the
stand, it was <i>even betting</i>; but the mare won by
about a head."</p>

<div class="pagenum">{347}</div>

<p>A variety of singular occurrences respecting the
invincible ardour and velocity, as well as persevering
fortitude, of greyhounds, might be introduced,
but a few must suffice. In February, 1800,
a <span class="smcap">brace</span> of
<span class="smcap lowercase">GREYHOUNDS</span> coursed a hare upwards of
<i>four miles</i> in a straight line from where she was
found, (exclusive of turns,) when she <i>ran herself
dead</i> before she was touched by the dogs.</p>

<p>A famous dog of the Reverend Mr. Corsellis,
who chanced to be wind-bound at Dover, coursed
a hare, who had beat a variety of pursuers in that
neighbourhood, when the dog proved so superior
to her in speed, and pressed her so close, that she
ran immediately for the cliff, as her only chance of
escaping; but the greyhound threw at, and caught
her at the brink, going with her in his mouth to the
<i>bottom</i> of the <i>precipice</i>, where they were literally
<i>dashed</i> to <i>pieces</i>. In 1797, a brace of greyhounds
coursed a hare over the edge of a chalk-pit, at Offham,
in Sussex, and both hare and dogs were found
dead at the bottom. In December, 1794, a company
of gentlemen were coursing at Finchingfield, in
Essex, when a hare was started, and a brace of
greyhounds starting from two different points, ran
against each other with so much violence that they
both <i>died on the spot</i>.</p>

<p>The greyhound is always mild and inoffensive,
and his fidelity cannot be better described than in
<span class="pagenum">{348}</span>
the words of the unfortunate <span class="smcap">Charles I.</span> who
said, amidst his courtiers, during his troubles, that
"the <span class="smcap lowercase">GREYHOUND</span> had all the good-nature of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">SPANIEL</span>, without his <i>fawning</i>."</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>GRIPES</h3><p>.—The disorder this term is meant to
imply, is more properly distinguished by the appellation
of <span class="smcap lowercase">INFLAMMATORY CHOLIC</span>, and is much
more painful and dangerous than that species of intestinal
complaint known by the name of <span class="smcap lowercase">FLATULENT CHOLIC</span>,
or <span class="smcap lowercase">FRET</span>. The inflammatory cholic,
or <span class="smcap lowercase">GRIPES</span>,
proceeds from a painful obstruction in
the intestines, occasioned by an accumulation of
indurated excrement, which must be <i>mollified</i>, and
<i>removed</i>, before <span class="smcap lowercase">EASE</span>
can be obtained. In cases of
this kind, no time should be lost, the intestines
being preternaturally distended beyond the original
intention of Nature, the pain is most excruciating,
the state of the animal dreadful; and, unless relief
is very speedily procured, <span class="smcap lowercase">INFLAMMATION</span> of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">BOWELS</span> immediately comes on,
<span class="smcap lowercase">MORTIFICATION</span>
follows, and <span class="smcap lowercase">DEATH</span> ensues.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>GROGGY</h3><p>—is a knowing term, peculiar to the
lower order of stabularian and horse-dealing gentry,
and implies a <i>tenderness</i> and <i>defect</i> in action, either
from a <span class="smcap lowercase">CHEST</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">FOOT FOUNDER</span>, or an injury sustained
in the <i>back sinews</i>, as mentioned under the
head <span class="smcap">Gorged</span>. Horses of this description, although
they come apparently <i>crippled</i> out of the stable,
<span class="pagenum">{349}</span>
yet, when the circulation is increased by action,
and the stiffness gone off as the perspiration comes
on, their exertion is incredible, and their endurance
of fatigue beyond conception. These are the kind
of horses by which the <i>inferior</i> kind of
<span class="smcap lowercase">JOBBERS</span>
obtain a livelihood, in supplying the <span class="smcap lowercase">POST-WORK</span>
upon the <i>roads</i>, and the
<span class="smcap lowercase">HACKNEY COACH-MASTERS</span>
of the <i>Metropolis</i>.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>GROOM</h3><p>—is the appellation by which a person
is known who is a complete and perfect master of
every part of stable discipline; if he is not so, it is
a prostitution of the word to admit the term; and
in any other point of view, he can rank in <i>no</i>
other degree than a <i>common stable-boy</i>. The qualifications
necessary to form <span class="smcap lowercase">A GROOM</span>
of superior excellence,
are almost as numerous and distinguishing
as those admitted to be requisite for the formation
of a <span class="smcap lowercase">MINISTER</span> of
<span class="smcap lowercase">STATE</span>: obedience, fidelity,
patience, mildness, diligence, humanity, and honesty,
are equally indispensible; without the whole
of which, he may be <i>entitled</i> to the denomination
of <i>a strapper</i> in a stable-yard; but will never prove
worthy to be thought <span class="smcap lowercase">A GROOM</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>If a groom is judicious, honest, and industrious,
intending <span class="smcap lowercase">DUTY</span> to his
<span class="smcap lowercase">MASTER</span>, and justice to himself,
he will never be prevailed upon to undertake
more than he can perform: the <span class="smcap lowercase">MASTER</span> who wishes
it, will always be instrumental to his own deception
<span class="pagenum">{350}</span>
and disappointment. Those who expect <span class="smcap lowercase">GROOMS</span>
to dress hair, as well as their horses; or to leave
the latter <i>wet</i> and <i>dirty</i>, or half dressed, in the
stable, while they dance attendance at the back of
the chair, during the <i>hour</i> of <i>dining</i>, must be content
to see their horses in <i>equal condition</i> with those
of the <span class="smcap lowercase">DANCING</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">MUSIC</span>, and
<span class="smcap lowercase">DRAWING MASTERS</span>, so
frequently seen, <i>in all weathers</i>, standing the disconsolate
hour, at different doors, in almost every
respectable street of the Metropolis.</p>

<p>The department in which <span class="smcap lowercase">A GROOM</span> is placed, if
the stud is valuable, must always be considered an
office of very considerable trust; where great confidence
is placed on <span class="smcap lowercase">ONE SIDE</span>, and strict integrity
should be observed on <span class="smcap lowercase">THE OTHER</span>. It is upon the
sobriety, steadiness, and invariable punctuality, of
the groom, that the <span class="smcap lowercase">HEALTH</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">SAFETY</span>, and
<span class="smcap lowercase">CONDITION</span>,
of every horse depends; and by his incessant
attention only can they be insured. <span class="smcap">Grooms</span>
(at least those completely qualified to be termed so)
are men who, from the arduous talk they stand engaged
in, the variegated nature of their servitude,
and the property entrusted to their care, lay claim,
and are entitled to, (their <i>sobriety</i>, <i>steadiness</i>, <i>fidelity</i>,
and <i>punctuality</i>, once established,) all the equitable
pecuniary compensation, and personal kindness,
their employers can possibly bestow.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{351}</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Grooms</span> and coachmen, deprived of <i>free agency</i>
by their situation in life, and doomed to eat the
bread of <span class="smcap lowercase">DEPENDENCE</span>,
<i>exist</i> to act solely upon compulsion;
they receive (sometimes the most supercilious)
injunctions only to <i>obey</i>, and are not permitted
the privilege of either remonstrance or expostulation.
Tacitly submissive, they encounter
the severity of the elements at <i>all hours</i>, and in <i>all
seasons</i>; and what should more influence the reflecting
mind in their favor, is, that when the inclemency
of the weather compels the <span class="smcap lowercase">RICH</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">OPULENT</span> to take shelter under the
<span class="smcap lowercase">ROOF</span> of
<span class="smcap lowercase">HOSPITALITY</span>,
servants must bear the "<i>pelting</i> of the
<i>pitiless</i> storm" unprotected; and when a satiety of
pleasure drives the reluctant frame of their superiors
to the downy pillow of nocturnal relief,
their task as yet "is but half performed," and not
unfrequently, till the broad sun serves only to remind
them of a speedy renewal of their daily labour.</p>

<p>These observations are impartially introduced,
to demonstrate their utility in the great scale of
<span class="smcap lowercase">OPULENT SOCIETY</span>,
as well as to bring home to the
reflection of the <i>illiberal</i> and <i>penurious</i>, palpable
conviction how highly they stand entitled (upon
many particular occasions, and distressing emergencies)
to <i>their</i> salutary tenderness and kind consideration.
It should be always held in remembrance
by <span class="smcap lowercase">SUPERIORS</span>,
that the services are <i>reciprocal</i>; and
<span class="pagenum">{352}</span>
that, in strict truth and candour, the obligation is
no greater on <i>one side</i> than the <i>other</i>.
<span class="smcap">Gratitude</span>
and <span class="smcap lowercase">AFFECTION</span> is much more likely (in a good
soil) to be excited by <i>kindness</i> than <i>severity</i>; and
instances are very rare of a <span class="smcap lowercase">SERVANT'S</span> fidelity having
been <i>obtained</i>, or <i>preserved</i>, by the unkind
treatment, or unjust <i>rigidity</i>, of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">MASTER</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grooms</span> of a certain description are, in general,
too much disposed to a degree of self-consequence,
and studiously endeavour to obtain an <span class="smcap lowercase">ASCENDANCY</span>
in the stabularian department, to which, if the
master imprudently and <i>pusillanimously</i> submits, he
becomes in some degree a non-entity, and bids
adieu to every particle of power upon his own
premises. The groom once possessed of <i>this power</i>,
and conscious of the ground he stands upon, becomes
so confident of his own <i>imaginary</i> superiority,
that the master is little more than an instrument
of mere passive convenience; barely permitted
<i>to think</i>, hardly presuming
<span class="smcap lowercase">TO SPEAK</span>, or, in fact,
<i>daring</i> to <i>obtrude</i> an
<span class="smcap lowercase">OPINION</span> even where his own
horses, their health, and safety, are concerned.
Grooms, so long as they continue to execute the
trust reposed in them with fidelity, that is, with
<i>care</i>, <i>kindness</i>, <i>punctuality</i>, and <i>attention</i> to their
<span class="smcap lowercase">HORSES</span>,
and a dutiful attachment to their employers,
will ever find themselves respected; but
when, from a false, ridiculous, and ill-founded
confidence, they exceed the bounds of consistency,
<span class="pagenum">{353}</span>
and go beyond their own sphere, in an <i>affected</i>
knowledge of the <span class="smcap lowercase">PROPERTY</span> of
<span class="smcap lowercase">MEDICINE</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">QUACKING</span>
their masters' <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSES</span>, and becoming <i>self-coined
Veterinarians</i>, they, in the eye of every judicious
observer, abandon their own merits, and render
themselves objects of both pity and contempt.</p>

<p>This <i>affectation</i> of
<span class="smcap lowercase">MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE</span> is so
very prevalent with <i>stabularian gentlemen</i>, that they
support it with a great degree of irritable tenacity;
and would sooner have even their <span class="smcap lowercase">HONESTY</span>, than
their <i>medical ability</i> called in question. To stem
the torrent of this dangerous practice, should be
the first principle, and persevering determination,
of every <span class="smcap lowercase">GENTLEMAN</span>,
who expects to see his <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSES</span>
in good <span class="smcap lowercase">CONDITION</span>, and his
<i>servants</i> in a state of
<i>uniformity</i>: and if he wishes to shield himself from
mental disquietude, and his horses from perpetual
persecution, he will lay a serious injunction, that
no <i>medicine</i>, or <i>nostrum</i>, whatever, shall be administered
to any horse or horses under the <span class="smcap lowercase">GROOM'S</span>
care, without the <span class="smcap lowercase">MASTER'S</span> acquiescence first had
and obtained.</p>

<p>If <span class="smcap lowercase">GENTLEMEN</span>
will condescend to give the subject
a trifling consideration, they will instantly perceive,
that the symptoms of disease, the state of
the body, the languor or velocity of the circulation,
and the property of the blood itself, must require
a greater degree of <span class="smcap lowercase">SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION</span>,
<span class="pagenum">{354}</span>
than people of this description have the
power of going into; from which palpable fact
may be inferred, the sole reason why they so often
miscarry in their experiments, and so frequently
render that a matter of permanent difficulty, which,
<i>properly treated</i>, would have proved no more than
a mere temporary inconvenience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grooms</span> (as well as Coachmen) should have it
strongly impressed on their memory, and never lose
sight of the reflection, that by a slight, or almost
momentary, deviation from the line of rectitude,
in either <i>error</i>, <i>inattention</i>, <i>inadvertence</i>, or <i>neglect</i>,
injuries may be sustained that neither <i>months</i> or
<i>money</i> can repair. Their minds should be always
alive to the interest of their employers; they should,
in all seasons (but more particularly in the colder
months) have it in perpetual recollection, that
<span class="smcap lowercase">COLDS</span> are sooner <i>caught</i>
than <i>cured</i>; that <span class="smcap lowercase">SWELLED LEGS</span>,
and <span class="smcap lowercase">CRACKED HEELS</span>, are much easier <i>obtained</i>
than <i>obliterated</i>; that <span class="smcap lowercase">LAMENESS</span>
(either by accident
or indiscretion) is easier <i>got</i> than <i>gotten rid of</i>; and
that <i>bad eyes</i> are much more frequently the effect of
a <i>careless</i> or a <i>malicious blow</i>, than of
"<span class="smcap">humours</span>,"
to which they are upon all occasions so industriously
attributed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colds</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">COUGHS</span> are suddenly acquired, and
by means at the time but little thought of, till the
event first <i>prompts</i>, and then <i>reproaches</i> retrospection.
<span class="pagenum">{355}</span>
A horse in fine condition, standing in a
warm and comfortable stable when <i>at home</i>, is always
liable to inconvenience <i>abroad</i>; accidentally
exposed to a <i>long</i>, <i>wet</i>, and <i>dirty</i> journey, or a severe
chase in sharp winds and unfavourable weather,
with a cold and comfortless stable after either, he
insures it almost to a certainty, without incessant
care and unremitting circumspection. A horse
after one or the other, should never be left <i>one minute</i>

<p><span class="smcap">Horses</span> kept in good style, should never have
their customary cloathing reduced, but with the

equally preserved entirely by the <i>state</i> of the <i>season</i>,
(or, in other words, by the <span class="smcap lowercase">SEASON</span> of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">YEAR</span>;)
and external air should never be additionally admitted
in <i>cold</i> and <i>chilling</i> winds, but with the
greatest circumspection; as it is to be remembered,
it is not the admission of such air <i>in itself alone</i>, by
which the injury is sustained, but by the contrast

it constitutes, when opposed to the previous warmth
of the stable.</p>

<h3>GROUSE</h3><p>;—the name of a

and was got by <i>Highflyer</i> out
of <i>Georgina</i>, who was got by <i>Matchem</i>, and was
own sister to <i>Conductor</i>. He was foaled in 1790;
and at three years old beat <i>Monkey</i>, <i>Silver</i>, <i>Tick</i>,
<i>Æacus</i>, <i>Agamemnon</i>, <i>Black Puss</i>, <i>Edwin</i>, <i>Rally</i>,
and <span class="smcap">Mr. Vernon's</span> filly by <i>Florizel</i> out of <i>Eve</i>,
three miles over the Beacon; but soon after falling
lame, he became a <span class="smcap lowercase">STALLION</span> in the

<i>First Fruits</i>, both good runners, he is in considerable
estimation, and will no doubt contribute to

<h3>GUN</h3><p>.—A <span class="smcap lowercase">GUN</span> is that

contribute so largely to the exigencies of State, and
the support of Government. <span class="smcap">Fashion</span>, that great
centre of fluctuation, has in this, as in almost every
thing else, wrought a very considerable change.
<span class="smcap">Guns</span> formerly in use for this purpose, were principally
constructed from three feet eight and ten inches,
to five and even six feet in the length of the
barrel only; which, by the effect of constantly increasing
ingenuity and persevering invention, are
now reduced to a standard varying but little <i>below</i>
two feet nine, or <i>above</i> three feet and an inch;
these having been improved to such a degree of
perfection, as to bring down a bird from

<h3>HACK</h3><p>.—Any horse appropriated to every kind
of purpose, (and upon which no great estimation or
value is placed,) it has been the custom for time
immemorial to distinguish by the appellation of
<span class="smcap lowercase">HACK</span>. Custom, however, has permitted a slight
deviation from a practice of long standing, and
<span class="smcap lowercase">A HACK</span> is now generally understood to imply the
idea of a <i>hired horse</i>; that is, a horse the property
of a <span class="smcap lowercase">HACKNEY-MAN</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">JOB</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">POSTMASTER</span>, who lets
out horses by the <i>day</i>, <i>week</i>, or <i>month</i>, and who is
obliged to take out an annual licence for permission
so to do, paying <span class="smcap lowercase">FIVE SHILLINGS</span>
for the same: doing
which <i>without</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">A LICENCE</span>,
renders him liable to a
penalty of <span class="smcap lowercase">TEN POUNDS</span>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hack horses</span>, whether for <i>riding</i> or <i>drawing</i>,
used in travelling post, are individually liable to a
duty of <i>one penny halfpenny</i> per mile, for as many
miles as such horse shall be engaged to travel
within a day, or any less time; but where the distance
cannot then be ascertained, <i>one shilling and
ninepence</i> shall be paid for each horse so hired.
This duty is demanded by the person letting the
horse or horses to hire, who, upon receiving such
payment, shall deliver to the person so hiring, one
<span class="pagenum">{360}</span>
or more <span class="smcap lowercase">STAMP-OFFICE TICKETS</span>, under a penalty of

<h3>HACKNEY</h3><p>,—in the general acceptation of the
word with the <span class="smcap lowercase">SPORTING WORLD</span>, is a horse superior
to all others upon the <span class="smcap">score</span> of
<span class="smcap lowercase">UTILITY</span>; being
rendered subservient to every office of exertion,
speed, and perseverance, or, in other words, to all
the <i>drudgery</i> and <i>labour</i> of his situation, from which
his cotemporaries, the <span class="smcap lowercase">RACER</span>,
the <span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTER</span>, and the
<span class="smcap lowercase">CHARGER</span>, by the <i>imaginary</i> superiority of their
qualifications, and pampered appearance, are always
<i>exempt</i>. It is the peculiar province of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">HACKNEY</span> to carry his master
<i>twelve</i> or <i>fifteen</i> miles in
an hour to covert, (where the <span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTER</span>
is in <i>waiting</i>,)
and sometimes to bring back the <span class="smcap lowercase">GROOM</span> with still
greater expedition, whose <i>engagements</i> may probably
have occasioned him to be much more in
<i>haste</i> than his <span class="smcap lowercase">MASTER</span>. It is in the department of
the <span class="smcap lowercase">HACKNEY</span> to encounter and overcome emergencies
and difficulties of every description: his constitution
should be excellent, and his spirit invincible;
he must be enabled to go <i>five-and-twenty</i> or
<i>thirty miles</i> at a stage, without <i>drawing bit</i>, and
without the least respect to the <i>depth</i> of the <i>roads</i>,
or the dreary state of the weather; and if he is not
equal to <i>any weight</i>, in these <i>trifling exertions</i>, he
will be held in no estimation as a <span class="smcap lowercase">HACKNEY</span> of
<span class="smcap lowercase">FASHION</span>.</p>

<h3>HACKNEY-MEN</h3><p>.—Those so called are the
proprietors of <span class="smcap lowercase">COACHES</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">CHAISES</span>, and
<span class="smcap lowercase">HORSES</span>, for
the accommodation of the public, and of whom
may be obtained vehicles of such description for
any length of time required. They are subject to
a <span class="smcap lowercase">LICENCE ANNUALLY</span>,
and various duties upon the
different carriages, all which are clearly explained
in concise abstracts (called "<span class="smcap lowercase">TAX TABLES</span>") from
the Acts of Parliament upon this particular subject.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>HAIR</h3><p>,—with which the frame of the horse is so
completely covered, and more familiarly termed
<span class="smcap lowercase">COAT</span>, is, in general, indicative of the <i>good</i> or <i>ill</i>
state of the horse; not only in respect to health,
but to his <span class="smcap lowercase">CONDITION</span>, for whatever work he may
be designed. If the subject is sleek in his coat,
with a glossy shining surface, soft and pliable in the
skin; not tight upon the ribs, as if firmly adhering
to the side; no enlargements upon the lower joints
of the legs, nor any <i>profuse</i> and <i>faint</i> perspiration
upon moderate work, the <span class="smcap lowercase">BLOOD</span> may be pronounced
in a <span class="smcap lowercase">HEALTHY STATE</span>, and the horse in
fair and <span class="smcap lowercase">GOOD CONDITION</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>If, on the contrary, the coat is rough, hollow,
staring different ways, of a variegated hue, with a
tinge of dust or scaly scurf beneath the surface, the
perspirative matter has been thrown upon the circulation
by a collapsion of the porous system, the
blood is become sizey, and disposed to morbidity,
<span class="pagenum">{362}</span>
in proportion to the preternatural weight by which
it is overloaded, and the obstructions it has to encounter
in its passage through the finer vessels, occasioned
by the languor of the circulation.</p>

<p>It is no uncommon thing for <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSES</span> in tolerable
<span class="smcap lowercase">GOOD CONDITION</span> to go
<i>all to pieces</i>, particularly in
the autumn months, without the least cause to be
assigned, the least reason to be suggested, by either
<span class="smcap lowercase">MASTER</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">GROOM</span>. Certain it is, that to two successive
acts of indiscretion, (or error in judgment,)
this very prevalent defeat may be attributed, without
the least fear of being at all <i>wrong</i> in the conclusion.
<span class="smcap">Grooms</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">COACHMEN</span>, in general, totally
unmindful of the <i>great heat</i> of their stables
during the night, throw open the doors immediately
upon coming in the morning, (regardless of even
<i>frost</i> or <i>snow</i>,) and frequently so continue during
the whole ceremony of "mucking out" and carrying
away the dung, if not with the addition of
<i>stripping</i> and <i>dressing</i> the horses into the bargain.</p>

<p>That the measure of indiscretion may be complete,
the ceremony not unfrequently terminates in
a three or four gallon pail of <i>hard cold</i> water from
the <span class="smcap lowercase">PUMP</span> in the
<i>yard</i> or <i>mews</i>; immediately after
which, a judicious observer will perceive</p>

<div class="list">

<ul>
 <li>"Each particular hair to stand on end,</li>
 <li>"Like quills upon the fretful porcupine."</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div class="pagenum">{363}</div>

<p>This prevailing practice has frequently laid the
foundation of various ills, not one of which were
ever attributed to the right cause. Such an accumulation
of <i>chilling frigidity</i> immediately succeeding
the extreme heat of the night, has often produced
diseases <i>without end</i>, at least those which
<i>ended</i> only with <i>life</i>. <span class="smcap">Colds</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">COUGHS</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">FEVER</span>,
(original or symptomatic,)
<span class="smcap lowercase">INFLAMMATION</span> of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">LUNGS</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">BAD EYES</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">BROKEN WIND</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">SWELLED LEGS</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">CRACKED HEELS</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">DROPSY</span> in the <i>chest</i>, with a long
list of <i>et ceteras</i>, or even death itself, may be occasioned
by circumstances which in themselves appear
so <i>trifling</i>, yet they sometimes prove of considerable
magnitude, and would attract the necessary
attention of any humane man looking after
his <i>own</i> horses; but in the present age of <i>duplicity</i>
and <i>deception</i>, are very little likely to affect the
<i>sensibility</i> or <i>integrity</i> of those looking after the
horses of <i>others</i>.</p>

<p>Where a loss of hair has been sustained by some
injury, as in broken knees, wounds after being
healed, blistering or firing, the growth may be promoted
(particularly in slight cases) by reducing
three drachms of <span class="smcap lowercase">CAMPHIRE</span>
to <i>fine powder</i>, then
letting it be well incorporated with <i>two ounces</i> of
<span class="smcap lowercase">SPERMA CÆTI OINTMENT</span> upon a marble slab, and a
small portion of it well rubbed into the part affected
at least <i>once</i>, but it will be better if persevered in
<i>twice</i> a day.</p>

<h3>HALTER</h3><p>—is that well-known convenience by
which a horse is fastened to the <span class="smcap lowercase">MANGER</span> when confined
in a <span class="smcap lowercase">STABLE</span>. Halters are of two kinds; the
one prepared of <i>twisted hemp</i>, the other made of
<span class="smcap lowercase">LEATHER</span>, having head-stall, throat-straps and
buckles, nose-band, &amp;c. and are called double-reined
hunting-collars. These are the safest in every
respect, and, although the most expensive at first,
are proportionally durable, and consequently
cheapest in the course of time. <span class="smcap">Hempen</span> halters
are sometimes injurious, in forming <i>swellings</i>, or
<i>lacerations</i>, upon the upper part of the head, behind
the ears, by the friction of the <i>hard-twisted
hemp</i> upon a part naturally tender and easily
susceptible. They are, however, now but very
little used, except in the stables of inferior inns,
and of indigent rustics.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>HALTER-CAST</h3><p>.—This is an accident to
which horses are constantly liable, and it very frequently
happens; but, in general, from the inadvertency
of leaving the rein of the halter of <i>too
great a length</i> on either one side or the other: for
when the horse is lying down, and has occasion
(from itching, or some other cause) to rub his
neck or head with the hind foot, it is no uncommon
thing to have it get entangled in the halter-rein;
which encircling the <i>cavity</i> of the <i>heel</i>, renders it
impossible for the animal to extricate himself, unless
the halter breaks in his favor; and during these
<span class="pagenum">{365}</span>
struggles, the heel is sometimes so terribly excoriated,
as to become not only a <span class="smcap lowercase">WOUND</span> of much
<i>trouble</i>, <i>anxiety</i>, and <i>loss</i> of <i>labour</i>, but often leaves
a very vexatious blemish, never to be removed.
It is, therefore, a truly necessary part of stable
circumspection, to have an occasional eye to a
circumstance in itself so seemingly insignificant,
when it is recollected, that its omission may be productive
of much mortification.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>HALTING</h3><p>—may be considered <i>a limping</i>, or
slight impediment to <span class="smcap lowercase">FREE</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">EASY ACTION</span>, implying
some kind of perceptible <i>defect</i> or <i>disquietude</i>,
not amounting to absolute <span class="smcap lowercase">LAMENESS</span>. Whenever
this irregularity in motion is first observed, and that
the legs do not move in corresponding uniformity,
or, in other words, as if they <i>were not fellows</i>, an
accurate examination should be immediately made
to ascertain the <span class="smcap lowercase">CAUSE</span>,
that it may be <i>speedily</i> relieved;
upon a very fair presumption, that what
might produce only a <i>limping</i> or <i>halting</i> in the first
instance, might probably become a confirmed
<span class="smcap lowercase">LAMENESS</span> by a perseverance in use,
without adverting
to the proper means of alleviation upon the
original discovery of something amiss.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">HAM, HOUGH, or HOCK</span></h3><p>,—is the joint in

nevertheless the seat of serious injuries, as <span class="smcap lowercase">BLOOD</span>

and <span class="smcap lowercase">BONE SPAVINS</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">CURBS</span>, &amp;c. the major part of

<h3>HAMBLETONIAN</h3><p>;—the name of <span class="smcap lowercase">A HORSE</span>
whose performances have ranked him in an equal
degree of retrospective celebrity with <i>Eclipse</i>,
<i>Highflyer</i>, <i>Diomed</i>, and the most famous runners
of the past or present day. He was bred by <span class="smcap">Mr. Hutchinson</span>,
of Skipton, near York, and foaled
in 1792; was got by <i>King Fergus</i>; dam by <i>Highflyer</i>;
grand-dam by <i>Matchem</i>.—1795. May 5,
when three years old, he won a stakes of fifteen
guineas each, over Hambleton, (five subscribers,)
beating <i>Sober Robin</i>, <i>Tarquin</i>, and another. At
York, May 20th, he won a sweepstakes of twenty
guineas each, four subscribers. He was then purchased,
with all his engagements, by <span class="smcap">Sir C. Turner</span>,
Bart. in whose possession he won, on the
27th of August, at York, a sweepstakes of 100
guineas each, (six subscribers,) beating <i>Benjamin</i>,
<i>Minus</i>, and <i>Maximus</i>. Two days after he won a
sweepstakes of fifty guineas each, four subscribers.
At Doncaster, the 22d of September, he won the
St. Leger stakes of twenty-five guineas each, twelve
subscribers. The next day he won the <span class="smcap lowercase">GOLD CUP</span>
of 100 guineas value, four miles, beating <i>Governor</i>,
<i>Capsicum</i>, and <i>Bradamant</i>.</p>

</div>

<div class="pagenum">{367}</div>

<p>1796. At the York August meeting he won a
subscription purse of 227<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> beating <i>Spread
Eagle</i>, <i>Sober Robin</i>, and another. The next day
he won the ladies' plate, beating Lord Darlington's
<i>St. George</i>. At this period of his uninterrupted
success, he was purchased by <span class="smcap">Sir Henry Tempest Vane</span>, Bart.
and at Doncaster, September 28,
won the <span class="smcap lowercase">GOLD CUP</span> of 100 guineas value, beating
<i>Sober Robin</i>, <i>Ambrosio</i>, and three others. In the
Newmarket Houghton meeting, November 2, he
beat Mr. Tatton's <i>Patriot</i> (who was got by <i>Rockingham</i>)
over the Beacon Course for 1000 guineas.</p>

<p>1797. Monday in the Newmarket Craven meeting,
he won the Craven stakes of ten guineas each,
beating <i>Sober Robin</i>, <i>Bennington</i>, <i>Paynator</i>, <i>Hermione</i>,
<i>Parisot</i>, <i>Cymbeline</i>, and five others. The
same day he received 250 guineas forfeit from
<i>Spread Eagle</i>. On Thursday, in the same week,
he beat Lord Clermont's <i>Aimator</i>, Beacon Course,
300 guineas. At York, August 23, he won one
third of the great subscription of 25 guineas each,
(25 subscribers,) to which was added a 50<i>l.</i> plate
given by the city. The next day he won another
third of the same subscription, with an additional
50<i>l.</i> plate by the City, beating <i>Beningbrough</i>, <i>Trimbush</i>,
and <i>Brilliant</i>. At Doncaster, the 27th of
September, he won the stakes of ten guineas each,
(ten subscribers,) with twenty guineas added by the
<span class="pagenum">{368}</span>
Corporation; and on the 29th received 100 guineas
forfeit from Mr. Sitwell's <i>Moorcock</i>.</p>

<p>In 1798 he was slightly lame, and never started.</p>

<p>1799. Monday, in the Craven meeting at
Newmarket, he beat Mr. Cookson's famous horse
<i>Diamond</i>, over the Beacon, for 3000 guineas, with
the odds of <i>five</i> to <i>four</i> in his favour, on account
of his superiority in size and strength; it being jocularly
observed by the rider of <i>Diamond</i> at <i>starting</i>,
that it seemed "a little like a race between
a mare and her colt." This match was the greatest
in popularity ever known from one extremity of
the kingdom to the other, and was decided before
one of the fullest meetings ever seen at Newmarket.
It was won by no more than <i>three parts</i> of a <i>length</i>,
to effect which the winner had felt the utmost force
of the spur; and, it was generally believed, if they
had then one hundred yards farther to have ran,
<i>Diamond</i> would have been <i>the winner</i>; in proof of
the justice of which opinion, <span class="smcap">Mr. Cookson</span> challenged
a repetition of the match, which was declined.</p>

<p>At Doncaster the same year, he won the renewed
stakes of ten guineas each, (fourteen subscribers,
with twenty guineas added by the Corporation,)
beating <i>eight</i> of the best horses in the north of
England. In 1800 he won the great subscription
<span class="pagenum">{369}</span>
at York, with 50<i>l.</i> given by the City, which was
the last time he started. He once ran out of the
Course, <i>soon after starting</i>, when running three
miles over York, 1797, for a sweepstakes of 100
guineas each against <i>Deserter</i> and <i>Spread Eagle</i>;
and paid one forfeit to <i>Sterling</i> (from being amiss
in 1792) at Newmarket; but <span class="smcap lowercase">NEVER WAS BEAT</span>.
He is now a stallion in high repute near Leeds, in
Yorkshire, at <span class="smcap lowercase">TEN GUINEAS</span>, and half a guinea the
groom.</p>

<h3>HAND</h3><p>—is the term for a mode of measurement
by which the height of <span class="smcap lowercase">A HORSE</span> is ascertained.
A <span class="smcap lowercase">HAND</span> (so called originally from its breadth) is

say a horse is <span class="smcap lowercase">LIGHT</span> in
<span class="smcap lowercase">HAND</span>, implies his being
playful, lively, champing his bit, firm upon his
haunches, and not dwelling upon the ground with
his fore feet. A horse is <span class="smcap lowercase">HEAVY</span> in
<span class="smcap lowercase">HAND</span>, when,
bearing his weight upon the bit, and lifting his fore
legs with reluctance, he goes <i>boring on</i>, with no
other sensation to the rider, than an eternal fear of
his pitching upon his head. A vicious horse,
breaking away with his rider, seems a dreadful
sight to a spectator, but can never be attended with
misfortune, if the rider is a good <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSEMAN</span>, and
has him "well in hand," which is, in fact, the
power of "gathering him together," or stopping
his career at pleasure.</p>

<p>Although the <i>left</i> is technically termed the
<span class="smcap lowercase">BRIDLE-HAND</span>,
yet a good horseman, or experienced
sportsman, will use either <i>right</i> or <i>left</i> with the most
perfect ease and dexterity; to effect which with the
greater freedom, young horsemen should constantly
<span class="pagenum">{371}</span>
practise an exchange of the reins from one hand to
the other in their daily excursions. The hand
should be delicately alive to every motion of the
horse; for it is the judicious management of one,
that is to constitute entirely the <i>good</i> or <i>bad</i> mouth
of the other. A horse is supposed to gallop awkwardly
(if not unnaturally) when he strikes into
that pace with his <i>left leg</i> foremost; to prevent
which, bear the rein to <i>the left</i>, with the bridle-hand,
and the horse invariably sets off with the
<i>right</i> leg.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hand-gallop</span> is that easy kind of pacing
adapted to the aged and infirm, who wish to
obtain every possible degree of motion, most consonant
to bodily ease; it is the degree of equestrian
action synonimous with, and more universally
known by, the denomination of <span class="smcap lowercase">CANTER</span>;
which is, in fact, the slowest, or most contracted gallop, and
can only be enjoyed by those who possess horses of
good temper, and well broke for the purpose.</p>

<p>A <span class="smcap lowercase">COLT</span> said to be "taken in hand," implies his
being brought from his wild state of nature, to be
<i>handled</i>, <i>quieted</i>, <i>led</i> about, and <i>stabled</i>, previous
to his being <i>broke in</i> for the <span class="smcap lowercase">SADDLE</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">HARNESS</span>.</p>

<p>A horse's <span class="smcap lowercase">FORE-HAND</span> includes
the fore quarters,
from the withers upwards to the tip of the ears;
the principal beauty and attraction of which depend
<span class="pagenum">{372}</span>
entirely upon the length and curvilinear form of
the neck, which increases or diminishes his <i>marketable
value</i>, in proportion as it is <i>well</i> or <i>ill</i>
formed.</p>

<h3>HANDICAP</h3><p>—is a sporting term, applicable to
either <span class="smcap lowercase">MATCH</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">PLATE</span>, or
<span class="smcap lowercase">SWEEPSTAKES</span>, in the following
way:</p>

</div>

<p>A, B, and C, put an equal sum into a hat. C,
who is the handicapper, makes a match for A and
B, who, when they have perused it, put their hands
into their pockets, and draw them out closed;
then they open them together, and if both have
money in their hands, the match is confirmed; if
<i>neither</i> have money, it is no match: in either of
these cases, the handicapper C draws all the money
out of the hat: but if one has money in his hand,
and the other <i>none</i>, it is then no
<span class="smcap lowercase">MATCH</span>; and he
that has the money in his hand, is entitled to the
whole deposit in the hat.</p>

<p>A <span class="smcap lowercase">HANDICAP PLATE</span>
is the gift of an individual,
or raised by <span class="smcap lowercase">SUBSCRIPTION</span>,
for which horses are
generally declared the day before running, at a
certain hour, by written information privately delivered
to the <span class="smcap">Clerk</span> of the <span class="smcap">Course</span>,
whose province
it is to make out the list, and hand it to the
<span class="smcap">Steward</span> of the <span class="smcap">Race</span>;
when the weight each
horse must carry is irrevocably fixed, (by whoever
<span class="pagenum">{373}</span>
the steward may appoint), and appears in the printed
lists of the following morning. Horses thus entered,
and declining the weight appointed for them
to carry, are of course permitted to be withdrawn,
without any forfeit or loss.</p>

<h3>HANDING</h3><p>—is sometimes used to express the
<span class="smcap lowercase">HANDING</span> of a <span class="smcap lowercase">COCK</span> during his battle in the pit. It
is, however, considered merely provincial, and peculiar
only to some particular parts of the country;
the <i>hander</i> of the <i>cocks</i> being now more generally
known by the denomination of a <span class="smcap lowercase">SETTER-TO</span>.—See
<span class="smcap">Cockpit Royal</span>.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>HANDLING</h3><p>,—a term applied by <span class="smcap lowercase">COCKERS</span> to
the judicious handling of a <span class="smcap lowercase">COCK</span>,
when brought up
from his <i>walk</i>, to ascertain whether he is in proper
condition to be placed in the <span class="smcap lowercase">PENS</span>,
and prepared
to fight in either the <span class="smcap lowercase">MAIN BATTLES</span>,
or the <i>byes</i>.
This is done by a particular mode of taking the
girt of the body by grasp, to discover the shape and
substance, the bone, the probable strength, as well
as the firmness or flaccidity of the flesh; upon the
aggregate of which so much depends, that in proportion
to these qualifications, he is <span class="smcap lowercase">ACCEPTED</span> or
<i>rejected</i> accordingly.</p>

<h3>HARBOUR</h3><p>—is a sporting term, applicable
solely to <span class="smcap lowercase">DEER</span>, and used only in
<span class="smcap lowercase">STAG HUNTING</span>;
when going to covert, and drawing for an out-lying
<span class="pagenum">{374}</span>

<h3>HARE</h3><p>.—This small, harmless, inoffensive animal
affords a greater diversity of sport in the field,
and a greater degree of luxurious entertainment
upon the table, than any species of <span class="smcap lowercase">GAME</span> in this,
or, probably, in any other country. The form,
shape, and make of the <span class="smcap lowercase">HARE</span> is too universally
known to require description; but the most curious
naturalists describe, and <i>affect</i> to believe, there are
<i>four kinds</i> of <i>hares</i> in different parts of the kingdom.
The fact is not so; the species is strictly
the same; but they are known to differ in size,
speed, substance, and somewhat in colour, according
to the soil, climate, fertility, or sterility, of
the country where they are bred.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hares</span> in hilly and mountainous countries are
smaller, but more fleet than any other; those who
are the natives of low, wet, marshy ground, or
moors, are larger, but less firm and delicious in
flesh, as well as less nimble in action. Hares bred
in open countries, diversified with woods, parks,
and arable lands, are in size between both, and
afford the best <i>coursing</i> before
<span class="smcap lowercase">GREYHOUNDS</span>, as
well as the longest <i>chases</i> before
<span class="smcap lowercase">HOUNDS</span>. Every
part of the hare is admirably formed for the promotion
<span class="pagenum">{375}</span>
of speed; which, in conjunction with other
natural advantages, greatly enables her to evade
the pursuits and stratagems of her numerous enemies.</p>

<p>The sense of <span class="smcap lowercase">SMELLING</span>,
as well as of <span class="smcap lowercase">HEARING</span>,
the hare possesses in a more exquisite degree than
any other animal; the latter of which may be justly
attributed to the great length, and singular formation,
of the ears, so well adapted to receive the
slightest vibration of sound, which even the earth
is so well known to convey. Its sense of smelling
is so incredibly nice, that the hare can <i>wind</i> an
<i>enemy</i> (either man or beast) at a considerable distance,
particularly in the stillness of the night; this
is evidently occasioned by the elastic formation of
the nostrils, and the depth of the division between
both, from whence has arisen the appellation of <i>a
hare-lip</i>, with which defect some of the human
species are afflicted, in consequence of fright to the
mother during the early months of pregnancy. The
ears seem to be the regulators of almost every
action; for during the chase <i>one</i> is always <i>erect</i>,
the other <i>horizontal</i>; unless in suddenly coming
upon an unexpected object, when they are for a
moment both erect; but, upon turning and renewing
her speed, they invariably resume their former
position.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{376}</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap lowercase">EYES</span> of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">HARE</span>, from the peculiar prominence
of their formation, enable her to distinguish
objects in almost every direction, without altering
the position of either her head or her body; and it
is remarkable, that their sight in a straight forward
line seems less perfect than in any other. The natural
timidity of the hare is excessive; she exists in
perpetual fear, and is tremblingly alive to every
breeze that can possibly produce alarm. Formed
entirely for <span class="smcap lowercase">RUNNING</span>,
she either possesses no power,
or makes no attempt <i>to walk</i>, but in her slowest
motion proceeds by <span class="smcap lowercase">JUMPS</span>.
The food of the hare
varies with the season, and consists chiefly of young
clover, green wheat, short sweet grass in parks or
upon lawns; and in the winter, parsley, turnip
greens, and other succulent plants. During severe
frosts, or deep snow, they make no small havock
amongst young fruit-trees and fragrant shrubs, by
nibbling the bark, thereby retarding their growth,
if not (as is frequently the case) promoting their
destruction. It is asserted by <span class="smcap">Mr. Daniel</span>, in his
publication called "<span class="smcap">Rural Sports</span>," that the
plantations of a <span class="smcap lowercase">GENTLEMAN</span>
in the county of <span class="smcap">Suffolk</span>,
had suffered so much in this way, that, in
defence of his improvements, he felt himself under
the necessity of destroying his <span class="smcap lowercase">HARES</span>,
when no less
than <i>five hundred</i> and <i>forty brace</i> fell victims on the
occasion.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{377}</div>

<p>The almost perpetual and incredible <i>destruction</i>
of <span class="smcap lowercase">HARES</span>, by
<span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTING</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">COURSING</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">SHOOTING</span>, and
the nocturnal <i>net</i> and <i>wire</i> of the <i>poacher</i>, (as well
as the infinite increase to supply that destruction,)
having occasioned suggestions, that they possess the
property of <span class="smcap lowercase">SUPERFŒTATION</span>,
it becomes immediately
applicable to introduce a remark or two under
that head. We are told by <span class="smcap">Mr. Daniel</span>, that "Sir
Thomas Brown, in his Treatise on <i>Vulgar Errors</i>,
asserts this circumstance from his own observation:
and <span class="smcap">Buffon</span> describes it as one of this animal's peculiar
properties, introducing an idea of hermaphrodite
hares; as well as that the males <i>sometimes</i>
bring forth young; that they are alternately
<span class="smcap lowercase">MALES</span>
and <span class="smcap lowercase">FEMALES</span>,
occasionally performing the functions
of <i>either</i> sex." Nothing can be more contemptible
and ridiculous than such conjectures; they are the
very essence of mental fertility; and it must suffice
to admit, that <span class="smcap">Sir Thomas Brown</span> and
<span class="smcap">Buffon</span>
were not inquisitive sportsmen, or not scientifically
acquainted with the parts necessary to generation.</p>

<p>For want of information so very easily to be obtained,
some one of these speculative writers promulgated
an erroneous assertion, every day liable
to the most palpable confutation; "that in the
formation of the genital parts of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">MALE HARE</span>,
the testicles <i>do not</i> appear on the <i>outside</i> of the
body, but are contained in the same cover with the
intestines." It should seem these authors write more
<span class="pagenum">{378}</span>
to <span class="smcap lowercase">SURPRIZE</span> than to
<span class="smcap lowercase">INSTRUCT</span>, or that they knew
little of the subject they wrote upon; as nineteen
sportsmen out of every twenty, who have handled
hares in the field, or taken them up before the
hounds, can demonstrate the contrary; as the testicles,
when the hare is full grown, are not only
prominently perceptible <i>externally</i>, but of considerable
size for so small an animal.</p>

<p>The natural fecundity of <span class="smcap lowercase">HARES</span> almost exceeds
belief; they continue to breed for nine months out
of the twelve; and leverets (young hares) are frequently
found and chopped by the hounds in <i>January</i>,
when the winter has been <i>mild</i>. The doe
hare goes a month after conception, and at her <i>first</i>
produce seldom brings forth more than <i>two</i>, afterwards
<i>three</i>, and sometimes <i>four</i>. Whenever the
number exceeds two, it is a received (and generally
believed just) opinion, that each of the young has
a white star in the forehead, which, however, is
gradually obliterated as they approach maturity.
The dam is supposed to suckle them about one-and-twenty
days; but takes care to separate them before
that time, and deposits them individually in such
<i>forms</i> as she has previously prepared for their reception,
at a considerable distance from each other;
but so situate, that she can afford maternal protection
to the whole. Their prolific powers, and
perpetual increase, will create no surprise, when
we are respectably informed, that a brace of hares,
<span class="pagenum">{379}</span>
(the doe pregnant when shut up) were inclosed in a
large walled garden, and proper aliment supplied
for their sustenance; when at the expiration of
<span class="smcap lowercase">TWELVE MONTHS</span> the garden was searched,
and the produce was <i>fifty-seven</i> hares, including the original
brace turned down: this fact alone demonstrating
the certainty, that the females begin to breed when,
or before, they are six months old.</p>

<p>The length of a hare's natural life is limited to
six or seven years, and they reach their full growth
in eight or nine months. The male is by much the
smallest, seldom exceeding in weight <i>five</i> or <i>six</i>
pounds; but the females, particularly in some very
rich and fertile counties, weigh from seven to
eight: some few instances have been known of
their weighing <i>nine</i> pounds, after being <i>paunched</i>.
The hare is supposed to be in gentle motion all
night during the summer months, and a great part
of it in the dreary nights of winter; during the
length of which <i>their works</i> are of such immense
perplexity, (in <i>heads</i>, <i>doubles</i>, and <i>circles</i>,) that
little expectation is entertained of finding a hare by
<i>the trail</i>, unless the field is taken early in the
morning, soon after she is gone <i>to seat</i>; which is
seldom, if ever, before the dawn of day; and in
the summer months, very frequently not till long
after day-light.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{380}</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap lowercase">HARE</span> till full grown is called
<span class="smcap lowercase">A LEVERET</span>,
and at any age is very difficult to be found <i>sitting</i>;
so nearly does the downy fleak (when close contracted)
approach the colour of the ground. In
this position the old and experienced <span class="smcap lowercase">SPORTSMAN</span>
will declare the gender of the hare <i>before</i> it is
started. The head of the male is short and round,
the whiskers longer, the slit in the nose wider, the
shoulders more ruddy, and the ears shorter and
broader, than those of the female; the head of
which is long and narrow; the ears long, and sharp
at the tip; the fur of the back of a dingey hue,
inclining to black, and of superior size to the male.
When a hare is observed in its <span class="smcap lowercase">FORM</span>, it may be
easily ascertained, by the <i>ears</i> only, whether it is a
<span class="smcap lowercase">BUCK</span> or <span class="smcap lowercase">DOE</span>;
and this is a useful kind of knowledge,
particularly at the latter part of the season,
when no man, but a hardened poacher, or <i>pot-hunting</i>
sportsman, would turn out a <i>female</i> hare
before either <span class="smcap lowercase">HOUND</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">GREYHOUND</span>, where there
is a chance of destroying <i>a leash</i>, or <i>two brace</i>, by
the wanton destruction of one.</p>

<p>If the hare found sitting is <span class="smcap lowercase">A BUCK</span>,
the ears will
be seen drawn close in a parallel line with each
other, directly over the shoulders, pointing straight
down the back; but if <span class="smcap lowercase">A DOE</span>,
the ears are distended
on each side of the neck, having a space between
them in the centre. In the chase, a <i>Jack hare</i>, (as
<span class="pagenum">{381}</span>
the male is sportingly termed,) after the first ring or
two, particularly in the spring months, flies his
country, goes straight forwards, and affords a good
run, but generally falls a victim to his own fortitude
at its termination. The female hangs closer
to her native spot, depending more upon her
instinctive efforts, in <i>heading</i>, <i>doubling</i>, <i>soiling</i>,
and <i>squatting</i>, than speed for her preservation.</p>

<p>Hares bred upon the downs, or in hilly countries,
are always the stoutest, and best enabled to
escape from <span class="smcap lowercase">GREYHOUNDS</span>; of which they are so
conscious, that they always make for the nearest
rising ground, so soon as started. When so severely
distrest that they plainly perceive there is
no other means of escape, they will take to a brick
or wooden drain for security, or even <i>run to earth</i>,
if one should luckily present itself in the emergency.
They are thought to foresee a <span class="smcap lowercase">CHANGE</span> in
the <span class="smcap lowercase">WEATHER</span>,
and to regulate their <i>sitting</i> accordingly.
After harvest they are found in stubbles,
banks of hedges, woods, and thickets; during the
fall of the leaf, they seat themselves more in open
fields; and when the severity of winter begins to
decline, warm, dry, hilly fallows are hardly ever
without them. As one species of <span class="smcap lowercase">GAME</span>, they are
held in high estimation; and, notwithstanding the
utmost efforts, by every degree of interdiction,
with all the <i>pains</i> and <i>penalties</i> that successive parliaments
could devise, from <span class="smcap">Richard</span> the Second
<span class="pagenum">{382}</span>
to the present day, for their preservation, and appropriation
to the use of the superior classes, yet
no laws ever proved more fallacious or deceptive;
for the infinity of <span class="smcap lowercase">POACHERS</span>, with which every
rural district abounds, and the alacrity with which
<span class="smcap lowercase">STAGE COACHMEN</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">COUNTRY HIGLERS</span> supply
their <i>friends</i>, will never let any inquirer be in want
of <span class="smcap lowercase">A HARE</span>,
who has his <i>five shillings</i> in hand as a
means of retribution. This
<span class="smcap lowercase">INSUFFICIENCY</span> of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">LAW</span> to check nocturnal depredation,
and progressive
infamy, is most sincerely to be regretted; but
experience has long held forth ample conviction,
that regret cannot produce redress.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>HARE-HUNTING</h3><p>—is a well-known sport, of
very ancient and enthusiastic enjoyment, reported,
by the most celebrated <span class="smcap lowercase">ANTIQUARIES</span>, to have been
established more than <i>two thousand</i> years before the
<span class="smcap">Christian æra</span>. Various opinions have been occasionally
promulgated, and perseveringly supported,
(by cynical rigidity, and religious severity,)
upon the "cruelty of the chase;" which, however,
is now <i>never</i> likely to be shaken in either <i>theory</i> or
<i>practice</i>, as to almost every
<span class="smcap lowercase">PACK OF HOUNDS</span> in the
kingdom there are clerical devotees, who are by
no means unworthy <span class="smcap lowercase">MEMBERS</span> of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">CHURCH</span>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hare-hunting</span>, though universal in every part
of England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, is in
the highest estimation in those open and champaign
<span class="pagenum">{383}</span>
counties where, from want of covert, a <span class="smcap lowercase">STAG</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">FOX</span> is never seen. Here the hares are stouter,
more accustomed to long nightly exercise, more
frequently disturbed, more inured to severe courses
before <span class="smcap lowercase">GREYHOUNDS</span>, and hard runs before hounds;
consequently, calculated to afford much better
sport than can be expected in either an inclosed or
woodland country. There are three distinct kinds
of hounds, with which this particular chase is pursued,
according to the soil and natural face of the
district where it is enjoyed. The large slow
<span class="smcap lowercase">SOUTHERN HOUND</span> is adapted to the low swampy,
marshy lands, so conspicuous in many parts of
Lancashire; as well as those in Norfolk, and various
others bordering upon the sea. The small,
busy, indefatigable <span class="smcap lowercase">BEAGLE</span> seems appropriated by
nature to those steep, hilly and mountainous parts,
where it is impossible for the best horse and boldest
rider to keep constantly with the hounds. The
hounds now called <span class="smcap lowercase">HARRIERS</span>, and originally produced
by a cross between the <span class="smcap lowercase">SOUTHERN HOUND</span>
and the <span class="smcap lowercase">DWARF FOX</span>, are the only hounds to succeed
in those open countries, where, for want of covert,
the hare goes five or six miles an end <i>without a turn</i>;
as is frequently the case in many parts of Oxfordshire,
Northamptonshire, Wiltshire, Hampshire,
and other counties; constituting chases <i>very superior</i>
to many <span class="smcap lowercase">FOX HOUNDS</span>, hunting beechen coverts and
woodland districts.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{384}</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hare-hunting</span>, when put in competition with
the pursuit of <span class="smcap lowercase">STAG</span> or
<span class="smcap">fox</span>, is much more gratifying
to the ruminative and reflecting mind, than either
of the other two; as it affords a more ample field
for minute observation upon the instinctive sagacity
of the <span class="smcap lowercase">GAME</span>,
and the patient, persevering fortitude
of the <span class="smcap lowercase">HOUND</span>,
in the various <i>heads</i>, <i>turns</i>, and
<i>doubles</i>, of the chase. Hence it is that hare-hunting
is principally followed, and most enjoyed, by
sportsmen in the decline of life; but with the
younger branches it is held in very slender estimation,
as they in general appreciate the <i>excellence</i> of
<i>sport</i> more by the difficulty in pursuing it, than by
its duration. Hare-hunting, in a woody or inclosed
country, is such a perpetual routine of repetition
within a small sphere, affording no more than a
continual succession of the <i>same thing</i>, that with a
zealous rider, and a high-mettled horse, it soon
palls upon the appetite of both. Young men, from
emulative motives, (naturally appertaining to their
time of life,) feel a pressing propensity to encounter
obstacles, and surmount difficulties, where the
effect of vigour and manly courage can be displayed,
and consequently prefer the kind of chase
where personal fortitude, and bodily exertion,
are brought more to the proof; and where, by covering
a larger scope of country, and with a much
greater proportional rapidity, a more pleasing and
extensive variety is obtained.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{385}</div>

<p>Another cause of mortification constantly presents
itself to young sportsmen with <span class="smcap lowercase">HARRIERS</span>, or
<span class="smcap lowercase">BEAGLES</span>, in the field: a valuable horse,
or a bold rider, are equally unnecessary in
<span class="smcap lowercase">HARE-HUNTING</span>,
and this is eternally brought to an incontrovertible
proof; for after a burst of five minutes, in which a
perfect hunter has an opportunity of displaying his
speed, and, after <i>clearing</i> some dangerous <i>leaps</i>, a
sudden turn or <i>double</i> of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">HARE</span>, brings him by the
side of a rustic upon a poney of <i>five pounds value</i>,
who is <i>nine</i> times out of <i>ten</i> as forward as himself.
The infinite time lost in <i>finding</i>, where hares are not
in great plenty; the frequency of <i>faults</i>; the persecuting
tediousness of <i>cold hunting</i>; and the injury
done to <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSES</span> in drizzling dreary days,
during hours of slow action, are great drawbacks to the
pleasure this species of hunting would otherwise
afford.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate sportsmen</span> will never avail themselves
of <i>immoderate</i> means to occasion a contraction
of their own sport, by a wanton or unnecessary
destruction of hares; too great a body of
hounds should never be brought into the field, or
any <i>unfair</i> modes adopted during the chase: <i>pricking
a hare</i> in the paths, or upon the highways, as
well as placing emissaries upon <i>the soil</i>, are paltry,
mean, and disgraceful artifices, that no genuine,
well-bred, <span class="smcap lowercase">HONEST SPORTSMAN</span>,
will ever permit;
but candidly acknowledge, if the <span class="smcap lowercase">HOUNDS</span> cannot
<span class="pagenum">{386}</span>
<i>kill her</i>, she ought to <span class="smcap lowercase">ESCAPE</span>.
In respect to numbers,
<i>less</i> than <span class="smcap lowercase">TWELVE</span>,
or <i>more</i> than <span class="smcap lowercase">EIGHTEEN</span>
couple ought never to be brought from the kennel
to the chase; nor, indeed, seldom are, unless with
those who think much less of <span class="smcap lowercase">SPORT</span>,
than of personal <i>pride</i> and <i>ostentation</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Beckford</span>, who is a perfect master of this
subject, has so completely investigated, and minutely
explained, every particular appertaining to
the <i>chase</i> of both <span class="smcap lowercase">HARE</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">FOX</span>, that as it is absolutely
impossible to suggest an <i>idea</i>, or communicate
a <i>thought</i>, but what must carry with it the appearance
of plagiarism; it will be more candid,
(evidently more honest) to introduce occasional
passages in his own words, as language more expressive,
by which they will be infinitely better understood.
He says, "By inclination he was never
a hare-hunter; but followed the diversion more for
air and exercise than amusement; and if he could
have persuaded himself to ride on the turnpike
road to the three mile stone, and back again, he
never should have thought himself in need of a
pack of harriers."</p>

<p>He then apologizes to "his brother <span class="smcap lowercase">HARE-HUNTERS</span>
for holding the sport so cheap, not wishing
to offend; alluding more relatively to his own
particular situation in a country where hare-hunting
is so bad, that it is more extraordinary he should
<span class="pagenum">{387}</span>
have persevered in it so long, than he should have
forsaken it then." Adding, "how much he respects
hunting in whatever shape it appears; that it is a
manly and a wholesome exercise, and seems by nature
designed to be the amusement of a Briton."
He is of opinion that more than twenty couple of
hounds should never be brought into the field;
supposing it difficult for a greater number to run
well together; and a pack of harriers can never be
complete who do not. He thinks the fewer hounds
you have, the less you soil the ground, which sometimes
proves a hindrance to the chase.</p>

<p>Custom has greatly varied in the practice of
<span class="smcap lowercase">HARE-HUNTING</span>
during the last thirty years: at that
time the hounds left the kennel at day-light, <i>took
trail</i> upon being <i>thrown off</i>, and soon went up to
their <span class="smcap lowercase">GAME</span>;
which having the pleasure to find by
their own instinctive sagacity, they pursued with
the more determined alacrity: a brace or leash of
hares were then killed, and the sport of the day
concluded, by the hour it is now <i>the fashion</i> for the
company to take the field. As the <i>trail</i> of a hare
lays both partially and imperfectly when it gets late
in the day, so the difficulty of <i>finding</i> is increased,
in proportion to the lateness of the hour at which
the hounds are thrown off; hence it is that
<span class="smcap lowercase">HARE-FINDERS</span>,
so little known at that time, are now become
so truly instrumental to the sport of the day.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{388}</div>

<p>Although their services are welcome to the eager
and expectant sportsman, yet it is on all hands admitted,
they are prejudicial to the discipline of
hounds; for having such assistance, they become
habitually <i>idle</i>, and individually <i>wild</i>: expecting
the game to be readily found for them, they become
totally indifferent to the task of finding it
themselves. <span class="smcap">Hounds</span> of this description know the
hare-finder as well as they know the <span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTSMAN</span>,
and will not only, upon sight, set off to meet him,
but have eternally their heads thrown up in the air,
in expectation of a view <span class="smcap lowercase">HOLLOA</span>!</p>

<p>With all well-managed packs, they are quietly
brought up to the place of meeting; and when
<i>thrown off</i>, a general silence should prevail, that
every hound may be permitted to do his own work.
Hounds well bred, and well broke to their business,
seldom want assistance. Officious intrusions frequently
do more harm than good: nothing requires
greater judgment, or nicer observation in speaking
to a hound, than to know the critical time when a
word is wanting. Young men, like young hounds,
are frequently accustomed to <i>babble</i> when newly entered,
and, by their frivolous questions or conversation,
attract the attention of the hounds, and insure
the silent <i>curse</i> of the <span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTSMAN</span>,
as well as the contemptuous indifference of every experienced
sportsman in the field.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{389}</div>

<p>Whenever a hare is turned out of her form, or
jumps up before the hounds, a general shout of
clamorous exultation too frequently prevails, by
which the hare's intentional course is perverted,
and she is often <i>headed</i>, or turned into the body of
the <span class="smcap lowercase">HOUNDS</span> to a <i>certain death</i>;
when, on the contrary,
was she permitted to go off with less alarm,
and to break view, without being so closely pressed
at starting, there is no doubt but much better runs
would be more generally obtained. Individual
emulation, or individual <i>obstinacy</i>, invariably occasions
horsemen in hare-hunting to be too near
the hounds, who, being naturally urged by the
rattling of the horses, and the exulting zeal of the
riders, often very much over-run the scent, and
have no alternative but to <i>turn</i> and <i>divide</i> amidst
the legs of the horses, so soon as they have lost it;
and to this circumstance may be justly attributed
many of the long and tedious <i>faults</i> which so frequently
occur, and render this kind of chase the
less attracting.</p>

<p>Gentlemen who keep <span class="smcap lowercase">HARRIERS</span> vary much in
their modes of hunting them; but the true sportsman
never deviates from the strict impartiality of
the chase. If a hare is found <i>sitting</i>, and the hounds
too near at hand, they are immediately drawn off,
to prevent her being <i>chopped</i> in her <i>form</i>: the hare
is then silently walked up by the individual who
previously found her, and she is permitted to go
<span class="pagenum">{390}</span>
off at her <i>own pace</i>, and her <i>own way</i>. The hounds
are then drawn over the spot from whence she
started, where taking the scent, they go off in a
style of uniformity, constituting what may be fairly
termed the consistency of the chase. Others there
are who never can, or <i>never will</i>, resist the temptation
of giving <i>the hounds a view</i>, and never fail to
tell you, both <span class="smcap lowercase">HARE</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">HOUNDS</span> run the better
for it. In addition to this <i>humane</i> method of beginning
the chase, every advantage is taken of the
poor affrighted animal's distress, amidst all its little
instinctive efforts for the preservation of life. The
hounds, instead of being permitted to run the soil,
and kill the hare by dint of their own persevering
labour, are constantly <i>capped</i> from <i>chase</i> to <i>view</i>;
and the object of the sport most wantonly and uncharitably
destroyed; for nothing less than a miracle
can effect its escape.</p>

<p>Those of nicer sensations enjoy the sport, but
enjoy it much more mercifully; and would rather
see their own hounds occasionally <i>beaten</i>, than, by
any unfair or unsportsman-like introduction, kill
their hare. These never permit a profusion of vociferous
assistance from the huntsman, who is enjoined
to an almost silent execution of his own
duty, that the hounds may not be prevented (by
<i>his noise</i>) from a strict and attentive performance of
theirs. If they <i>throw up</i>, upon a dry or greasy
fallow, a footpath, a highway, or a turnpike-road,
<span class="pagenum">{391}</span>
a thousand busy bustling endeavours are to be self-made
for a recovery of the scent, before any one
effort is permitted to assist in <i>lifting them along</i>;
and even then, not till every patient and persevering
struggle has failed of success. The sportsman
of this description admits of no device, stratagem,
or <i>foul play</i> whatever; the
<span class="smcap lowercase">HOUNDS</span> must <i>hunt</i>
the hare; they must go over every inch of ground
she has gone before them; they must <i>hit off</i> their
own checks, recover their <i>faults</i>; and, by cold
hunting, <i>pick it along</i>, where, in passing through a
flock of sheep, the ground has been foiled, and
the chase proportionally retarded. Early and extensive
<i>casts</i> are unjust, unless upon some unexpected
or unavoidable emergency; as the repeated
interventions of sheep, or intersections of roads, or
fallows in a dry season; when it would be impossible
to make the least progress in getting the hounds
along without assistance.</p>

<p>When hounds come to a check, not a horse
should move, not a voice should be heard: every
hound is eagerly employed, exerting all his powers
for a recovery of the scent, in which, if not officiously
obstructed, they will most probably soon
succeed. At such times there is generally, and unluckily,
some <i>popinjay</i> in the field, who, unfortunately
for himself, never speaks but upon the most
<i>improper</i> occasion; rendering, at such moment,
the judicious observation of <span class="smcap">Mr. Beckford</span> truly
<span class="pagenum">{392}</span>
neat and applicable, that "when in the field, he
never desires to hear any other <i>tongue</i> than a
<span class="smcap lowercase">HOUND</span>." Whenever assistance to hounds
is become unavoidably necessary, and the chase cannot
be carried on without, sound judgment, and long
experience, are necessary to speedy success. Casts
cannot be made by any fixed, certain, or invariable
rules, but must, at different times, be differently
dependent upon the <i>chase</i>, the <i>soil</i>, the <i>weather</i>,
and the <i>kind</i> of <i>country</i> you are hunting in. It
may, in one instance, be prudent to try <i>forward</i>
first; in another, to try <i>back</i>; as it may be judicious,
or necessary, to make a <i>small</i> circular cast
at one time, and a much <i>larger</i> at another; and although
to one of the field, circumstances may appear,
in <i>either</i> instance, to have been nearly the
same, yet they have not been so in the "mind's
eye" of the <span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTSMAN</span>,
(or the person hunting the
hounds,) upon whose superior knowledge, or circumspection,
the <i>good</i> or <i>ill</i> effect of the experiment
must depend.</p>

<p>None, but weak or inexperienced sportsmen,
ever presume to obtrude their opinions when hounds
are <i>at fault</i>; those who do it, soon find the interference
is <i>ill-timed</i>, and that it only excites a contemptuous
indifference. Strangers cannot be too
cautious and circumspect in the field, if they wish
to avoid just reproofs, and not to encounter rebuffs:
some there are, whose hard fate it is to become
<span class="pagenum">{393}</span>
conspicuously ridiculous upon every occasion
that can occur, and to such, unfortunately for them,
occasions are seldom wanting. During the chase,
they are riding <i>into</i>, <i>over</i>, or <i>before</i>, the
<span class="smcap lowercase">HOUNDS</span>;
and at every <i>check</i>, asking some vexatious, trifling
question of the <span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTSMAN</span>;
or entering into a frivolous
conversation with what seems <i>to them</i> the
most vulnerable subject of the company. Officious
individuals of this description, whose error too frequently
originates in a certain degree of personal
pride, and unbounded confidence, should learn to
know, that "the post of honour is a private
station;" as well as that an <i>old pollard</i> in a painting,
might be admirably calculated to form a respectable
object in the back-ground, but never intended
by the artist to become a principal figure in
the front of the picture.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>HARE NETS</h3><p>—are of two sorts, one of which
will be found described under the head "<span class="smcap">Gate-nets</span>;"
the other are called <span class="smcap lowercase">PURSE-NETS</span>, and are
exactly in the form of cabbage-nets, but of larger
and stronger construction. These occasionally afford
collateral aid to the former; for being fixed at
the different meuses (either in hedges, or to paling)
where <span class="smcap lowercase">HARES</span> are expected to pass, and the ground
being scoured by a <i>mute lurcher</i>, as there described,
the destruction is certain. These nets are the nocturnal
engines of old and experienced <span class="smcap lowercase">POACHERS</span>,
doing more mischief where hares are plenty, in <i>one</i>
<span class="pagenum">{394}</span>
<i>night</i>, than the <i>wire</i> manufacturers can accomplish
in a week.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>"HARK FORWARD!"</h3><p>—is a sporting exclamation,
well known in the practice of the field, and
affords to every distant hearer, authentic information,
that the hounds are <i>a-head</i>, and going on with
the chase. It sometimes happens, that, in very
large and thick coverts, no man or horse existing
can be in with the hounds; at which times (particularly
in stormy weather) recourse must be had to
every means for general accommodation. The
best sportsmen are often thrown out <i>for miles</i>, and
not unfrequently for <i>the day</i>, by various turns of
the <span class="smcap lowercase">CHASE</span> in
<span class="smcap lowercase">COVERT</span>, and then breaking <i>up the
wind</i> on a contrary side, leaving every listening expectant
in an awkward predicament, if not relieved
by the friendly communication of "<span class="smcap lowercase">HOIC FORWARD!</span>"
from one to another, enabling the whole
to continue the sport.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>HARE-PIPES</h3><p>—were instruments so curiously
constructed, to imitate the whining whimper of
<span class="smcap lowercase">A HARE</span>,
that, being formerly found a very destructive
nocturnal engine in attracting the attention of
hares, and bringing them within the certain possession
of the <span class="smcap lowercase">POACHER</span>,
their use was prohibited (by
particular specification) in every Act of Parliament
for the preservation of game, from the reign
of Richard the Second, to the present time; although
<span class="pagenum">{395}</span>
it is natural to conclude, there is not <i>now</i>
such an article to be seen, or found in the kingdom.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>HARRIERS</h3><p>—are the species of hound appropriated
solely to the pursuit of the <span class="smcap lowercase">HARE</span>, and from
thence derived their present appellation. The
breeding experiments so long made, and the various
crosses so repeatedly tried, by the best judges
in the kingdom, seem at length to have centered
between the old southern and the dwarf fox hound.
<span class="smcap">Mr. Beckford</span>, whose "Thoughts" no sensible
man, or judicious sportsman, will presume to dispute,
was entirely of this opinion, and proved it
by his practice; for he says, "his hounds were a
cross of both these kinds, in which it was his endeavour
to get as much bone and strength, in as
small a compass as possible. It was a difficult undertaking.
He bred many years, and an infinity of
hounds, before he could get what he wanted, and
had at last the pleasure to see them very handsome;
small, yet very bony: they ran remarkably well
together; ran fast enough; had all the alacrity that
could be desired, and would hunt the coldest scent.
When they were thus perfect, he did as many
others do—he parted with them."</p>

</div>

<p>Notwithstanding the criterion of excellence thus
laid down, the same sort of hound (as a harrier)
is by no means applicable to every soil: the
<span class="pagenum">{396}</span>
southern hound will be always in possession of
<span class="smcap lowercase">THE SWAMPS</span>,
as will the beagles of the mountainous
and hilly countries. Those who delight in seeing
hounds bred and drafted to a certain degree of uniformity,
in <i>size</i>, <i>bone</i>, <i>strength</i>, and <i>speed</i>, strictly
corresponding with the opinion of <span class="smcap">Mr. Beckford</span>,
will not find it time lost, to take the field with the
<i>harriers</i> of his <span class="smcap">Majesty</span>, kept at Windsor: they
are, as they ought to be, the best pack, and the
best hunted, this day in the kingdom. See the
Frontispiece; where every <span class="smcap lowercase">MAN</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">HORSE</span>, and
<span class="smcap lowercase">HOUND</span>, is individually a portrait.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>HART</h3><p>—is the sporting term synonimous with
<span class="smcap">Stag</span>, (which <span class="smcap lowercase">SEE</span>,)
and was, in all forest laws and
records, constantly in use to signify the same. At
present, however, it is considered almost obsolete,
and never so expressed in sporting report, or conversation.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>HART ROYAL</h3><p>.—A stag hunted by <span class="smcap lowercase">KING</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">QUEEN</span>,
obtaining his perfect liberty by beating the
hounds, was formerly called a hart royal; and proclamation
was immediately made, in the towns and
villages of the neighbourhood where he was lost,
that he should not be molested, or his life attempted
by any farther pursuit; but that he should continue
in a state of unrestrained freedom, with power to
return to the <span class="smcap lowercase">FOREST</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">CHACE</span> from whence he was
taken at his <span class="smcap lowercase">OWN FREE WILL</span>.
This ceremony is,
<span class="pagenum">{397}</span>
however, discontinued, and bids fair to be buried
in a perpetual oblivion; as two instances have recently
occurred worthy recital: one in the neighbourhood
of <span class="smcap">High Wycombe</span>, where the
<span class="smcap lowercase">STAG</span> was
killed before the hounds, by a rustic, during the
heat of the chase, in which the <span class="smcap">King</span> at the time
was personally engaged. And another at <span class="smcap">Mapledurham</span>,
near <span class="smcap">Reading</span>, where the deer was wantonly
shot, as he lay in a willow bank near the
Thames, two days after he had beaten the hounds;
yet it is publicly known, that no steps were taken
to prosecute the offenders, which probably originated
in his Majesty's clemency.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3><span class="smcap">HAUNCH and HIP</span></h3><p>—of a horse, have been
hitherto (but not with strict propriety) used in a
similar sense: nice observers might say one begins
where the other ends, or that one immediately
succeeds the other. The haunch is that part of the
hind quarter extending from the point of the hip-bone,
down the thigh to the hock; but as it is
a part well known, and but little subject to partial
disease or accident, it lays claim to no particular
description. The term of "putting a horse upon
his haunches," implies the making him constantly
fix the principal weight of the frame upon his hind
quarters, by which practice he bears less upon the
bit, and becomes habitually light in hand. Horses
hard in mouth, and heavy in hand, frequently undergo
the ceremony of being put upon their
<span class="pagenum">{398}</span>
haunches in the trammels of a <span class="smcap lowercase">RIDING SCHOOL</span>,
where, by too severe and inconsiderate exertions,
sudden <i>twists</i>, <i>distortions</i>, and <i>strains</i>, are sustained
in the <span class="smcap lowercase">HOCKS</span>, which terminate in
<span class="smcap lowercase">CURBS</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">SPAVINS</span>
never to be obliterated.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3><span class="smcap">HAUNCH of VENISON</span></h3><p>—implies the hind
quarter of a <span class="smcap lowercase">FALLOW DEER</span>, (either buck or doe,)
cut in a particular form for the table. The hind
quarter of a <span class="smcap lowercase">STAG</span>, or
<span class="smcap lowercase">HIND</span>, also passes under the
same denomination; but it is more applicable to
form a distinction, and call the former a haunch of
venison; the latter, a haunch of red deer.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>HAW</h3><p>.—The haw is that cartilaginous part of a
horse's eye, plainly perceptible at the inner corner
next the forehead, which internally constitutes a
circular groove for the easier acceleration of the eye
in its orbit. When confined within its natural and
proper sphere, it is but just in sight, when taking a
front view of the horse; but when it has acquired a
preternatural degree of enlargement, it protrudes
over part of the orb, partially obstructs the sight,
particularly in that direction, and constitutes no
small disfiguration of the horse. Ingenuity heretofore
suggested the possibility of extirpation with the
knife, which operation has been frequently performed,
but with too little success to justify a continuance
of the practice. It having been found,
that when the haw was taken away by a regular process,
<span class="pagenum">{399}</span>
and by the hand of the most expert <span class="smcap lowercase">OPERATOR</span>,
yet the eye, for want of its former support, was
observed to become contracted in the socket, and
a total deprivation of sight to follow, evidently demonstrating
"the <span class="smcap lowercase">REMEDY</span> worse than the
<span class="smcap lowercase">DISEASE</span>;"
as well as to convince us, it is sometimes more
prudent</p>

<h3>HAWKS</h3><p>,—as birds of prey, are divided into
two sorts, called long and short winged hawks: of
the former there are ten, and of the latter eight;
but their names, and particular description, is so
remote from the language and manners of the present
time, and their use so nearly obsolete, that the
least animadversion would prove entirely superfluous.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>HAWKING</h3><p>—was some centuries since a sport
of much fashion and celebrity; the <span class="smcap lowercase">HAWKS</span> being as
regularly broke and trained to the pursuit and
taking of game, as are the best <span class="smcap lowercase">SETTERS</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">POINTERS</span> of the present day. It is, however, so
completely grown into disuse, and buried in oblivion,
that there does not appear the least glimmering
of its ever attaining a chance of <span class="smcap lowercase">SPORTING</span> resurrection.</p>

</div>

<div class="pagenum">{400}</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>HAY</h3><p>—is the well-known article of grass, cut in
its most luxuriant and nutritious state during the
months of <span class="smcap">June</span> and <span class="smcap">July</span>;
when the succulent
parts, tending most to putrefaction, being extracted
by the powerful rays of the sun, it acquires (if the
season should prove dry, and favourable for the
operation) a degree of fragrancy nearly equal to a
collection of aromatic herbs. <span class="smcap">Hay</span>, in this state,
is a most attracting sort of <span class="smcap lowercase">ALIMENT</span> to horses of
every description, and is so truly grateful to the
appetite, that it is often accepted when corn is
refused. Of hay there are different kinds; as
<span class="smcap lowercase">MEADOW</span> hay,
<span class="smcap lowercase">CLOVER</span> hay, and
<span class="smcap lowercase">SAINFOIN</span>. The
first is called natural grass, as the spontaneous produce
of what is termed pasture land: the two latter
are deemed artificial, as being cultivated upon
arable land, and affording crops of only <span class="smcap lowercase">BIENNIAL</span>
and <span class="smcap lowercase">TRIENNIAL</span> duration; when the fertility of
which is so far exhausted, as to render a crop of
the ensuing year an <i>unprofitable</i> prospect, the land
is ploughed up, to undergo its regular routine of
cultivation, when crops of this description are renewed,
by sowing the seed previously preserved for
the purpose.</p>

</div>

<p>Fine, rich, short, fragrant meadow hay, has by
much the preference with the <span class="smcap lowercase">SPORTING</span> world; as
well as with all those who employ horses in light
work, and expeditious action: it varies much in its
property; not more in respect to the manner in
<span class="pagenum">{401}</span>
which it is made, than to the soil it is produced
from. Those who are anxious for the <span class="smcap lowercase">HEALTH</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">CONDITION</span> of their horses,
are always as judiciously
circumspect in the choice of their hay as their corn;
experimentally knowing, as much depends upon
the excellence of one as the other. Hay produced
from rushy land, or mossy moors, is always of inferior
quality, and impoverishes the blood of the
horses who eat it, in proportion to its own sterility.
Those who inconsiderately purchase <i>cheap hay</i> upon
the score of economy, will have to repent their
want of liberality. Whether it is <i>coarse</i>, and
barren of nutritious property, or <i>ill-made</i>, <i>musty</i>,
and repugnant to appetite, the effect sooner or
later will be much the same; and those who imprudently
make the experiment, will soon find, that
horses ill-kept, and less fed than nature requires,
for the support of the frame, and the supply of the
various secretions by the different emunctories,
will soon display, in their external appearance, a
tendency to disease.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clover hay</span> is produced in most counties in the
kingdom; it is generally sown with <span class="smcap lowercase">BARLEY</span>,
sometimes with <span class="smcap lowercase">OATS</span>, and least of all with
<span class="smcap lowercase">WHEAT</span>: it
constitutes, upon dry ground, a profitable and convenient
pasture in the autumn, and affords its general
crop the following season. If luxuriant, it is
mown twice in the same summer; but the second
crop is not considered equal in value to the first.
<span class="pagenum">{402}</span>
This hay is said, by those who ought to be the best
enabled to judge and decide, superior to every
other as to its nutritious property: this may be admitted
in a certain degree, so far as its increasing
the crassamentum of the blood, and proportionally
promoting its viscidity; rendering horses who are
constantly fed upon it (for instance, farmers horses)
fuller in flesh, duller in action, and thicker in the
wind, than those who are supported upon food of
a lighter description. Although well calculated for
slow and heavy draft horses, it is by no means
adapted to those of expeditious action; for the
blood thus thickened, becoming more languid or
tardy in its circulation, would, when propelled
through the vessels with great and sudden velocity,
in hunting, or journies of speed upon the road,
inevitably lay the foundation of different inflammatory
disorders.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sainfoin</span> is rather an article of necessity than
choice, and very little known in some parts of
England, where nature has been more liberal in
her diversity of vegetation: it is principally cultivated
in the upland counties, where neither a meadow,
stream, or rivulet, is to be seen for a great
number of miles in succession. Many very extensive
farms in the lower counties west of the metropolis,
feel the want of pasture land, not having a
single acre of meadow or natural grass in possession.
Necessity, the mother of invention, has, however,
<span class="pagenum">{403}</span>
so amply furnished a variety of substitutes, that
their horses, and stock of every kind, seem equal,
upon the average, to what is produced in any other
part of the kingdom.</p>

<h3>HAYS</h3><p>—are a particular kind of nets for taking
<span class="smcap lowercase">RABBITS</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">HARES</span>, the use of which are proscribed
in almost every Act to be found in the penal statutes
for the <span class="smcap lowercase">PRESERVATION</span> of

<h3>HAYWARD</h3><p>—is a manorial parochial officer,
appointed to preserve the privileges, and protect the
rights, immunities, and cattle, of those who are entitled
to commonage of certain lands, wastes, &amp;c. He
derives from his appointment, authority to drive his
district at stated periods, well known in its vicinity;
to impound strays, and to prevent nuisances
of diseased cattle; or any other impropriety of
cattle breaking bounds, and destroying fences, of
which it comes within the intent of his office to take
cognizance. To all which there are certain local

<h3>HAZARD</h3><p>—is, beyond a doubt, the most
fashionable and fascinating <span class="smcap lowercase">GAME</span> ever yet invented
for the expeditious and instantaneous transfer of
immense sums from one hand to another. It is a
<span class="smcap lowercase">GAME</span> of
<span class="smcap lowercase">CHANCE</span>; and, when <i>fairly</i> played, is the
<span class="smcap lowercase">FAIREST</span> upon which a stake can possibly be made,
from <i>one</i> guinea to a
<span class="smcap lowercase">THOUSAND</span>, or to any amount
whatever; the winning or losing of which is decided
with so much rapidity, that the adventurer can
never be more than a few moments in <i>suspense</i>,
although he may be many years in <span class="smcap lowercase">REPENTANCE</span>.
Hazard is the game of <i>nocturnal</i> celebrity, by
which the best estates have been impoverished, and
immense property destroyed: it is played with a
box and pair of dice, and is of considerable antiquity,
as noticed by <span class="smcap">Shakespeare</span> in Richard the
Third, whom he has made to say,</p>

</div>

<div class="list">

<ul>
 <li>"Slave, I have set my life upon a <span class="smcap lowercase">CAST</span>,</li>

<p class="nodent">The person holding the
<span class="smcap lowercase">BOX</span> is called the <span class="smcap">Caster</span>,
who having been <i>set</i> as much money by the surrounding
company (or any individual) as he proposes
<i>to throw for</i>, and the <span class="smcap lowercase">STAKE</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">STAKES</span> being
<span class="pagenum">{405}</span>
deposited within a centrical circle upon the table,
he then throws the <i>dice</i> from the <span class="smcap lowercase">BOX</span>,
and whatever
number appears upon the surface is termed "the
<span class="smcap lowercase">MAIN</span>;" and so vociferated loudly by a person
called the <span class="smcap">Groom Porter</span>, who stands above the
rest, and whose business it is to call the <i>main</i> and
<i>chance</i>, furnish fresh <i>dice</i> when demanded, and to
receive the money for a <i>box-hand</i> when due. So
soon as the <i>main</i> is declared, which, in fact, is the
number by which the Caster's opponents must
abide for themselves, the Caster throws a second
time, and this number is called the <i>chance</i>, being
his <i>own</i> chance against the <i>main</i> previously thrown;
and so named, because it is the number of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">MAIN</span> of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">PLAYERS</span> against the
<i>chance</i> of the <i>individual</i>
who is the <span class="smcap">Caster</span>, and makes stakes against
the whole, or any part of the rest.</p>

<p>The <i>main</i> and <i>chance</i> being proclaimed by the
<span class="smcap">Groom Porter</span>, odds are generally laid between
the throws (upon the termination of the event) according
to the numbers opposed to each other, and
according to the scale by which all <i>bets</i> upon the
game are regulated, and strictly observed. The
Caster may, or may not, engage in any of these
bets, which he very frequently does, as a hedge
(or fence) to his own stakes, when the odds are <i>six</i>
to <i>four</i>, or <span class="smcap lowercase">TWO</span> to
<span class="smcap lowercase">ONE</span>, in his favour: at any rate,
he continues to throw the dice in succession, till
either the <i>main</i> or <i>chance</i> appears: if the main is
<span class="pagenum">{406}</span>
<i>first</i> thrown, those who "set the Caster" draw
their money; the Caster is then said to have
"thrown out," and passes the box to his next
neighbour: on the contrary, should he have thrown
his <i>own chance first</i>, he is then the winner, and of
course not only draws all the money he <i>staked</i> and
<i>betted</i>, but continues to <span class="smcap lowercase">HOLD</span> the
<span class="smcap lowercase">BOX</span>, and throw
a "new main" for <i>any sum</i> he wishes to be <i>set</i>, in
which a Caster is never known to be disappointed.</p>

<p>When a <span class="smcap">Caster</span> has <i>thrown in</i> (that is, has
won) three times in succession, it is termed "a
<span class="smcap lowercase">BOX HAND</span>," and he then pays
<i>half a guinea</i> to the
<span class="smcap">Groom Porter</span>, for the privilege of playing, the
use of box and dice, negus, &amp;c. provided for the
accommodation of the company. The box continues
in the Caster's possession so long as he continues
to <i>throw in</i>, (paying an additional half guinea
every <i>third</i> time of winning;) but the first time he
loses, he resigns the box to the player sitting next
to him, unless he requests, and is permitted to renew
his <i>own play</i>, which is then called taking "a
back hand." There are more minute distinctions,
as well as a fixed table of the odds during the play;
but they are too long for insertion; and could not
be so clearly comprehended by theory, as understood
by practice.</p>

<h3>HEAD</h3><p>.—The correct formation of a horse's
head is so indispensibly necessary to the striking
<span class="pagenum">{407}</span>
symmetry and corresponding uniformity of the
whole, that its make should never be inadvertently
overlooked in a hasty purchase. The head, the
crest, the curve of the neck, and the entire of the
forehand, are what may be termed the predominant
features, or distinguishing traits, which <i>alone seen</i>,
hold forth, in general, a tolerably just idea of what
may be expected to follow. In the present state of
equestrian improvement, the beauty of a horse's
head is too well known to require a literary description:
nor would the word itself have been introduced,
but to remind every class of sportsmen, that those
who purchase a horse too <i>thick in the jole</i>, or a head
<i>too large</i> for the <span class="smcap lowercase">BODY</span>,
must never expect to be
complimented upon the beauty of the acquisition.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3><span class="smcap">HEAD, pain in</span></h3><p>.—Horses, it is supposed and
admitted, may be subject to pains in the head;
and that such pains may proceed from causes it is
impossible to explore. As, therefore, every attempt
at definition must rest upon conjecture, it
is evidently better not to advance opinions founded
upon uncertainty, by which <i>many</i> may be <i>misled</i>,
none either <span class="smcap lowercase">INSTRUCTED</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">ENTERTAINED</span>. For
symptoms, see <span class="smcap">Ears</span>.</p>

<h3>HEAD-STALL</h3><p>—is the part of a caveson,
bridle, or hunting-rein halter, which passes round,
<span class="pagenum">{408}</span>

the reins of either are affixed, for use in the field

<h3>HEATH-FOWL</h3><p>—are a species of <span class="smcap lowercase">GROUSE</span>,
(passing under the denomination of <span class="smcap lowercase">BLACK GAME</span>,)
of which there are different sorts, individually expressed
in the various acts of successive Parliaments
for the preservation of the game; as "<span class="smcap lowercase">GROUSE</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">HEATH-COCK</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">MOOR-GAME</span>, or any such fowl." To
prevent the general destruction that must evidently
follow, if game of this description was pursued and
taken at all seasons of the year without restraint,
the Legislature has wisely provided a remedy by
the following prohibition, exclusive of the penalties
annexed to other Acts for killing without the
necessary qualifications.</p>

</div>

<p>By the 13th George Third, c. lv. s. 2, No person
shall <i>kill</i>, <i>destroy</i>, <i>carry</i>, <i>sell</i>, <i>buy</i>,
or have in
his <i>possession</i>, any <span class="smcap lowercase">HEATH-FOWL</span>,
commonly called
<i>black game</i>, between the <i>tenth</i> day of <i>December</i> and
the <i>twentieth</i> day of <i>August</i>; nor any
<span class="smcap lowercase">GROUSE</span>, commonly
called <i>red game</i>, between the <i>tenth</i> day of
<i>December</i> and the <i>twelfth</i> day of <i>August</i>; nor any
<span class="smcap lowercase">BUSTARD</span> between the <i>first</i> day of

<span class="pagenum">{409}</span>
not exceeding <span class="smcap lowercase">THIRTY</span>, nor less than

<h3>HEAVIER</h3><p>.—A <span class="smcap lowercase">STAG</span>
deprived of his testicles
by <span class="smcap lowercase">CASTRATION</span>, is then called a
<span class="smcap lowercase">HEAVIER</span>, which
operation is occasionally performed, that a supply
may not be wanting for the <span class="smcap lowercase">CHASE</span> during the time
of <i>rutting</i>; in which the <span class="smcap lowercase">STAG</span>
is perpetually ranging
from one <span class="smcap lowercase">HIND</span> to another, for three weeks or
longer; not allowing himself the comforts of
<span class="smcap lowercase">FOOD</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">SLEEP</span>, or
<span class="smcap lowercase">REST</span>. Towards the termination he becomes
lean, languid, and dejected; when, having
executed the task prescribed by <span class="smcap">Nature</span>, he withdraws
himself from society, to seek repose and
food. At this period he is so ill-adapted for
<span class="smcap lowercase">SPORT</span>
with the <span class="smcap lowercase">HOUNDS</span>,
that the operation of castrating
was adopted as an alternative to the temporary suspension
of the <span class="smcap lowercase">ROYAL CHASE</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>It is worthy of remark, that if a stag undergoes
the operation when his horns are <span class="smcap lowercase">SHED</span>,
they <i>never</i>
grow again; on the contrary, if it is performed
while the horns are in perfection, they will never
exfoliate; and it is equally remarkable, that being
deprived of only <i>one</i> testicle, the horn will not regenerate
on <i>that</i> side, but will continue to grow, and
annually shed on the <i>other</i>, where the single testicle
has not been taken away. <span class="smcap">Heaviers</span> are of great
strength, and stand a long time before hounds; for
<span class="pagenum">{410}</span>
which reason the hunting establishment of his <span class="smcap">Majesty</span>
in <span class="smcap">Windsor Forest</span> is never without a regular
succession.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3><span class="smcap">HEAVY in HAND</span></h3><p>.—A horse is said to be
heavy in hand, when, from want of spirit, he goes
sluggishly on, bearing his whole weight upon the
<span class="smcap lowercase">BIT</span>; as if the hand of the rider
alone prevented his
pitching upon his head; and this to a good horseman
is one of the most unpleasing <i>defects</i> a
<span class="smcap lowercase">HORSE</span>
can possess. Horses of this description should be
rode in a Weymouth bridle, (see <span class="smcap">Bit</span>,) and constantly
made to feel the <span class="smcap lowercase">CURB</span> rein; when at the
same moment, that useful monitor the <i>spur</i> should
be brought into brisk and sudden contact with the
body; a perseverance in which practice will be
found the only mode to remedy the inconvenience.
See <span class="smcap">Hand</span>.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>HEELS</h3><p>.—The heels of a horse, critically speaking,
imply only that part of the hoof which is the
very reverse of the toe; seated behind, and forming
the back of the foot, across the widest end of the
frog, extending from one point of the heel to the
other. Custom has, however, so far extended
both the idea and the expression, that in the present
general acceptation of the word, it is admitted to
include the feet as high as the fetlock-joint; so that
the heels are subject to accidents, inconveniencies,
defects, and blemishes, as <span class="smcap lowercase">CRACKS</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">SCRATCHES</span>,
<span class="pagenum">{411}</span>
<span class="smcap lowercase">OVERREACHES</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">GREASE</span>, &amp;c. The heels of a horse,
to be good, should be high, (that is, of a proper
length from the hair above to the ground below,)
firm, and substantial, open on each side the frog,
and never should be cut down <i>too low</i> by the destructive
instrument of the <span class="smcap lowercase">SHOEING-SMITH</span>; an
error in both judgment and practice, to which may
be justly attributed the frequent failure in the back
sinews; for where the heels are unnaturally reduced,
and the tendons in part deprived of their
support, they have evidently to encounter a preternatural
distension, by which the elasticity is partially
destroyed, and some of the fibrous coats consequently
ruptured.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>HEELS NARROW</h3><p>—is a defect, or inconvenience,
to which <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSES</span> are constantly subject;
but they are produced much more by the officious
obtrusions of <span class="smcap lowercase">ART</span>,
than any deficiency in the original
formation of <span class="smcap lowercase">NATURE</span>.
Horses with narrow
heels are generally those who have had very little
attention paid to the state of the feet, by either
<span class="smcap lowercase">MASTER</span> or <i>man</i>,
during the operation of <span class="smcap lowercase">SHOEING</span>;
and where the journeyman smith too often, from
absolute idleness, affixes a shoe <i>too narrow</i> to the
<span class="smcap lowercase">FOOT</span>, and then, to increase the injury,
reduces the
<span class="smcap lowercase">FOOT</span> to the dimensions of the <i>shoe</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>This grievance is much easier prevented than remedied;
for when once a <i>destruction</i> of <i>parts</i> has
<span class="pagenum">{412}</span>
been inconsiderately occasioned, a <span class="smcap lowercase">REGENERATION</span>
may not be easily obtained. The cruel and invincible
practice of applying the <i>hot shoe</i> to the
<span class="smcap lowercase">FOOT</span>
(by way of fitting it) during the act of shoeing,
contributes in no small degree to the contraction of
the heel; and when this injury is once sustained,
great care and constant attention become necessary
to solicit a renovation. Whether it has been occasioned
by the fatal operation of the <i>cutting-knife</i>,
the fashionable back-stroke friction of the <i>rasp</i>, or
the fiery effect of the <i>hot shoe</i> when conveyed from
the <span class="smcap lowercase">FORGE</span> to the
<span class="smcap">foot</span>, the direct road to relief is
precisely the same: nightly stopping with any applicable
composition calculated to mollify the bottom
of the hoof, and to promote its expansion,
with a plentiful impregnation of sperma-cæti oil
daily, are the only sure and certain means by
which the heels can be restored to their original
and proper formation.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>HEELER</h3><p>—is the person who affixes the deadly
weapon called <span class="smcap lowercase">A SPUR</span>
(made of either steel or silver)
to the heel of a <span class="smcap lowercase">GAME COCK</span>, when taken from the
pen previous to his being carried to the
<span class="smcap lowercase">COCK-PIT</span> to
fight his battle. A hard-hitting cock, who is perpetually
fighting with effect, and gives his adversary
no time to stand still, or look about him, is
likewise called <span class="smcap lowercase">A HEELER</span>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">HELPS, or AIDS</span></h3><p>,—are terms appertaining

<span class="smcap lowercase">RIDING-SCHOOL</span>, little
known elsewhere, and totally unconnected with the
sports of the field. <span class="smcap">Professors</span> technically describe
<i>seven</i> helps necessary to complete the lesson given
to a horse; as the <span class="smcap lowercase">VOICE</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">WHIP</span>,

<span class="smcap lowercase">CALVES</span> of

<h3>HEROD</h3><p>,—commonly called <i>King Herod</i>, was
the first horse of his time as <span class="smcap lowercase">A RACER</span>,
and afterwards
as <span class="smcap lowercase">A STALLION</span>. He was bred by the then
<span class="smcap">Duke</span> of <span class="smcap">Cumberland</span>,
and got by <i>Tartar</i> out of
<i>Cypron</i>, who was got by <i>Blaze</i>; he was foaled in
1758, and, after beating every horse that could be
brought against him at four, five, and six years
old, he became a stallion of the first celebrity, and
transmitted a greater progeny to posterity, than any
other horse in the whole annals of sporting, unless
<i>Eclipse</i> and <i>Highflyer</i> (his son) are admitted upon
the score of equality.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>HIDEBOUND</h3><p>—is an impoverished state of the
frame and system to which horses are frequently reduced,
and partakes much more of neglect in food
and stable discipline, than of constitutional defect,
or acquired disease. A horse said to be <span class="smcap lowercase">HIDEBOUND</span>
has the appearance of being emaciated; the coat is
of a dingy variegated hue, staring different ways,
with a scurfy dust underneath; the skin is of an unpliable
rigidity, seeming to adhere closely to the
<span class="pagenum">{414}</span>
internal parts, denoting a deficiency of the fluids,
an obstruction of the porous system, and a languor
in the circulation.</p>

</div>

<p>The whole, or any part of these, may originate
in various causes; as a short allowance of <span class="smcap">good</span> and
healthy food, or a profusion of <i>bad</i>. Nothing will
produce it sooner than <i>hard</i> work with <i>bad</i> keep,
and a constant exposure to all weathers, in the severity
of the winter season. Musty oats, mouldy
hay, and winter straw-yards, are generally the
harbingers of this appearance, which in all cases is
very easily removed: good stable discipline, in
wisping and dressing, regular daily exercise, a few
mashes nightly of ground malt and bran, equal
parts, followed by a cordial ball every morning, or
an antimonial alterative powder nightly in the
mash, will soon be found to answer every expectation,
and restore the subject to good condition.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>HIGHFLYER</h3><p>—was the name of a late celebrated
<span class="smcap lowercase">HORSE</span>, that, taken "for all in all," (as a
<span class="smcap lowercase">RACER</span> and a
<span class="smcap lowercase">STALLION</span>,) far exceeded any other
ever known in this kingdom. He was foaled in
1774; was got by <i>Herod</i> out of <i>Rachel</i>, who was
got by <i>Blank</i>; her dam by <i>Regulus</i>, &amp;c. He was
purchased of the breeder, when a colt rising two
years old, by the late <span class="smcap">Lord Bolingbroke</span>, and
was then thought to be getting too large and unpromising
for any capital performances upon the
<span class="pagenum">{415}</span>
turf. It was, however, observed by the training
groom, that he displayed astonishing powers in
some of his first trials; and it was upon <i>his</i> suggestion
<i>Highflyer</i> was immediately named in the
most capital sweepstakes and subscriptions then
open; winning all which with the greatest ease, he
was at the very zenith of his celebrity as
<span class="smcap lowercase">A RACER</span>,
when <span class="smcap">Lord Bolingbroke</span>,
disgusted with the villainous
deceptions and variegated vicissitudes of
<span class="smcap lowercase">THE TURF</span>,
as well as declining daily in his health,
<i>Highflyer</i> was purchased of his Lordship by
<span class="smcap">Mr. Tattersal</span>,
who fixed him as a stallion at a farm of
his own near Ely, in Cambridgeshire, where his success
soon stamped the spot with the name of <span class="smcap">Highflyer Hall</span>,
which it will most probably ever retain.
Here he covered for some years at
<span class="smcap lowercase">THIRTY GUINEAS</span>;
and from the almost incredible number of mares he
was permitted to cover, it was concluded he produced
to his owner no less than from fifteen hundred
to two thousand pounds a year, for many years
in succession. His progeny of winners only exceeded
<span class="smcap lowercase">THREE HUNDRED</span> in number, who received,
in subscriptions, plates and sweepstakes, above a
<span class="smcap lowercase">THOUSAND PRIZES</span>. Amongst the most celebrated
of his get were <i>Escape</i>, (who once sold for 1500
guineas,) <i>Euphrosyne</i>, <i>Bashful</i>, <i>Maid of all Work</i>,
<i>Plutitia</i>, <i>Sir Pepper</i>, <i>Sir Peter Teazle</i>, <i>Skylark</i>,
<i>Skyrocket</i>, <i>Skyscraper</i>, <i>Spadille</i>, <i>Rockingham</i>, <i>Toby</i>,
<i>Thalia</i>, <i>Walnut</i>, <i>Old Tat</i>, <i>Vermin</i>, <i>Skypeeper</i>,
<i>Grouse</i>, <i>Oberon</i>, <i>Screveton</i>, <i>Diamond</i>, <i>Sparkler,</i>
<span class="pagenum">{416}</span>
<i>Guildford</i>, <i>Moorcock</i>, and <i>Stickler</i>: of whom several
are now stallions in the highest reputation at
ten and fifteen guineas each.</p>

<h3>HIND</h3><p>—is the female of the species called <span class="smcap lowercase">RED DEER</span>,

<h3>HIP-SHOT</h3><p>.—The <span class="smcap lowercase">DEFECT</span> so termed is an injury
frequently sustained in the <span class="smcap lowercase">HIP JOINT</span>, but not
always with the same degree of severity. It is a
ligamentary twist, or distortion, by which the
<i>junction</i> of the <i>bones</i> is materially affected, but not
amounting to absolute <span class="smcap lowercase">DISLOCATION</span>; although it
may proceed from a variety of causes, in sudden
shocks from the different prominences of, or cavities
<i>in</i>, an uneven and irregular pavement; <span class="smcap lowercase">BLOWS</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">STRAINS</span>, or
<span class="smcap lowercase">WRENCHES</span>, (in drawing heavy loads,)
as well as by <span class="smcap lowercase">SLIDING</span>, or
<span class="smcap lowercase">FALLING</span>; yet there is
little doubt but it occurs much oftner from <i>carelessness</i>,
<i>inattention</i>, and <i>brutality</i>, either by a violent
blow from the post of the stable door, in being
hastily led in or out, than by any other means
whatever. Let what will be the cause, a cure is seldom
completely effected; for as the injury is not
only deeply, but critically seated, so if the horse,
after any medical means have been used, is turned
out to obtain strength, a repetition of work generally
<span class="pagenum">{417}</span>
produces a relapse of the injury originally sustained.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>HOCK, or HOUGH</h3><p>.—The joint of the leg
<i>behind</i>, corresponding with the knee <i>before</i>, is so
called. Its office, in sustaining the principal
weight, and various turns of the body, renders it
liable to injuries, which, when they happen, are
not unfrequently both severe and permanent.
<span class="smcap">Bone spavins</span>,

<span class="smcap lowercase">CURBS</span>, are of

<h3>HOLD</h3><p>—is a term of trifling import, yet, as it
appertains to the important act of propagation between
the <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSE</span> and the
<span class="smcap lowercase">MARE</span>, its emphatic signification
cannot be omitted. When a mare has
taken the horse, that is, when copulation is completed,
a doubt generally arises, whether the <span class="smcap lowercase">MARE</span>
will <i>hold</i>; that is, whether she sufficiently retains
the male semen to constitute <span class="smcap lowercase">CONCEPTION</span>. The
mare being brought to the horse on the <i>ninth</i> day,
from the first time of covering, if she again receives
the horse, that alone is held a sufficient
proof she <i>did not hold</i> before: she is, nevertheless,
brought again to the horse at the end of another
nine days, and when she has refused <i>twice</i> to take
the horse, she is then said to be <span class="smcap lowercase">STINTED</span>,
and no
doubt entertained of her being in <span class="smcap lowercase">FOAL</span>.</p>

<h3>HOOF</h3><p>.—The hoof of a horse is that hard and
horny substance at the lower extremity of the legs,
coming into contact with the ground, and upon
which are placed shoes, made of iron, for the preservation
of the feet. The hoof, to be perfect and
uniform, should nearly circumscribe five eighths
of a circle, with a transverse line from one point
of the heel to the other, as if a segment of three
eighths was taken away; in addition to which
form, it should be solid in substance, smooth to the
hand, and free from the contracted rings, or
wrinkles, similar to those upon the horns of cattle,
by which the age is ascertained.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hoofs</span> are very different in both property and
appearance, and a great deal of this depends upon
the manner in which they are treated. The well-known
and well-founded adage, that "<span class="smcap">Doctors differ</span>,"
was never more verified than in the subject
before us; previous to the necessary remarks
upon which, it will be proper to point out the
distinct or opposite texture and property of such
hoofs, before we advert to the most applicable
mode of treatment for each. The hoofs of some
horses are so naturally dry, and so defective in animal
moisture, that they gradually contract, become
apparently compressed, and narrow at the
heel, as well as acquire a degree of <i>brittleness</i>
hardly to be believed; in which state <i>splinters</i> are
frequently scaling off from the <span class="smcap lowercase">EDGES</span>
of the <span class="smcap lowercase">HOOF</span>,
<span class="pagenum">{419}</span>
at many places where the nails are unavoidably inserted
to secure the position of the <span class="smcap lowercase">SHOE</span>,
for the preservation of the <span class="smcap lowercase">FOOT</span>.</p>

<p>These are the species of hoof much more
susceptible of injury than any other, particularly
of <span class="smcap lowercase">SANDCRACKS</span>; defects which,
when they happen,
very much reduce the value of the horse if offered
for sale; not more in respect to the
<span class="smcap lowercase">BLEMISH</span>, than
the perpetual apprehension and expectation of his
becoming irrecoverably <span class="smcap lowercase">LAME</span>.
Hoofs of this description
should be plentifully impregnated with
sperma-cæti oil every night all round the foot; and
the bottom should be stopped with a composition
of stiff cow-dung, and the skimming of the pot in
which fat meat has been boiled, previously preserved,
and well incorporated for that purpose. It
has been asserted by those who speculate, and propagate
the report of <i>fancy</i> for <span class="smcap lowercase">FACT</span>,
that "unctuous or greasy applications are prejudicial to the feet,"
of which indefinite, vague and imperfect expression,
the <i>weak</i> and <i>wavering</i> happily avail themselves,
and boldly declare, under sanction of the
equivocal mutation in meaning, that every thing
<i>greasy</i> is injurious to the <span class="smcap lowercase">HOOFS</span>.</p>

<p>It is a degree of justice that so egregious an absurdity
should be exposed. Without descending
to a minute and scientific analyzation of the hoof
in its animated state, to ascertain how far it is, or
<span class="pagenum">{420}</span>
is not, a <span class="smcap lowercase">POROUS</span> substance,
it becomes only necessary
to demonstrate its possessing the property of
<span class="smcap lowercase">ABSORPTION</span> from <i>external</i> application.
That this
may be the more clearly comprehended, let it be
remembered, if a single drop of <span class="smcap lowercase">SPERMA-CÆTI OIL</span>
is left upon a quire of white paper, it will, by its
penetrative property, pass through each leaf of the
quire, till every particle of its moisture is exhausted,
where it terminates in a space little larger
than the point of a needle: from whence it is fair
to infer, this article, in a state of perfect liquefaction,
will insinuate itself into, or go through,
any possible substance where a liquid can be supposed
to pass: this admitted, upon clear and indisputable
proof, it becomes necessary to proceed
to its effect upon the <i>dry</i>, <i>hard</i>, <i>contracted</i>, <i>brittle</i>
hoof of the <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSE</span>.</p>

<p>If the foot is held up from the litter with the
hand, and with the stable-brush well impregnated
with <i>oil</i>, so as to be left tolerably wet upon
the surface, persevering patience (by holding
the foot from the ground a few minutes) will
prove, that the oil with which the hoof was so
plentifully basted, has nearly <span class="smcap lowercase">DISAPPEARED</span>,
although <i>no drop</i> has fallen to the ground. What
will the <i>rigid</i> disputant, or <i>cynical</i> Sceptic, oppose
to this fact, when asked what is become of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">OIL</span>
so recently laid on? From the fertile resources of
"<span class="smcap lowercase">EXHALATION</span>,"
"<span class="smcap lowercase">EVAPORATION</span>," or even "<i>running
<span class="pagenum">{421}</span>
off</i>," he can derive no assistance to support
him in the erroneous opinion he has formed; and
perhaps an obstinacy, from time and custom become
habitual, will not permit him (till his judgment
is more matured by experience) to admit,
that it is lost to the eye, and taken up by
<span class="smcap lowercase">ABSORPTION</span>.
This, however, is the fact, and to the incredulous,
who are open to conviction, and willing
to make the experiment, it will appear, that
this treatment of the hoof, and the
<span class="smcap lowercase">STOPPING</span> previously
mentioned, (if nightly persevered in,) will,
in <i>less</i> than <span class="smcap lowercase">THREE SHOEINGS</span>,
completely restore
and improve the most brittle and battered hoofs in
the kingdom. So much cannot be said of <i>unctuous</i>
or <i>greasy</i> substances; for, from their confidence,
not possessing the property of penetration, they
can add <i>none</i> to the <span class="smcap lowercase">EXPANSION</span>
of the <span class="smcap lowercase">HOOF</span>; from
the dry and preternaturally contracted state of
which the defect generally arises; and by the additional
growth and distension of the hoof alone can
be relieved.</p>

<h3>HORSE</h3><p>—is the name of the most beautiful,
the most useful, and the most valuable, animal,
this or any other nation has to boast: the majestic
extent of his formation, the graceful ease of every
motion, the immensity of his strength, the smooth
<span class="pagenum">{422}</span>
and glossy surface of his skin, the pliability of his
temper, and, above every other consideration, his
rapidity of action, and general utility, render him
highly worthy the care, attention, and pecuniary
estimation he is now held in from one extremity
of the earth to the other. He is the most spirited
and most powerful of all creatures; yet the most
generous, docile, grateful and obedient to the purposes
of man as an individual, as well as to all the
<span class="smcap">agricultural</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">COMMERCIAL</span> advantages of society
at large. He may be justly termed the great
main-spring of <span class="smcap lowercase">PLEASURE</span> to one class,
and of <span class="smcap lowercase">PROFIT</span>
to the other; without whose aid, the eternal
routine of <i>both</i> must come to immediate termination,
constituting a <span class="smcap lowercase">CHAOS</span> very far beyond the
most fertile imagination to conceive or describe.</p>

</div>

<p>The natural history, the form, and general
utility, of the horse, is become so perfectly familiar
to every eye, that the less will be required
upon those points in explanation. The various
pleasurable purposes, and useful talks, to which
horses are appropriated in this country, has long
since demonstrated the consistency of cultivating,
by select and judicious propagation, each particular
kind of stock, so as to render it individually
applicable to the use for which it is intended. The
numbers <i>annually</i> produced, and <i>annually</i> destroyed,
within the circle of our own isle (even in
time of peace) exceed common conception, and of
<span class="pagenum">{423}</span>
which no computation can be tolerably formed.
The long list constantly bred for, and engaged
upon, the <span class="smcap lowercase">TURF</span>; the
<span class="smcap lowercase">SPORTS</span> of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">FIELD</span>; the national
establishment of <span class="smcap lowercase">MILITARY CAVALRY</span>; the
carriage horses of the opulent, rattling through
every street of every city and large town in the
kingdom; the <i>thousands</i> employed in
<span class="smcap lowercase">AGRICULTURE</span>,
as well as all the <span class="smcap lowercase">DRAFT</span> work of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">METROPOLIS</span>;
in addition to the <i>infinity</i> annexed to
<span class="smcap lowercase">MAIL</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">STAGE COACHES</span>,
as well as to the <span class="smcap lowercase">POST WORK</span>,
and those useful drudges denominated
<span class="smcap lowercase">ROADSTERS</span>, in the possession of every class of
people, constitute an aggregate that in contemplation
excites the utmost admiration.</p>

<p>The constantly increasing <span class="smcap lowercase">OPULENCE</span>, or the
constantly increasing <span class="smcap lowercase">LUXURY</span>,
has rendered the demand
for horses so very superior to the example of
any previous period, that no comparative statement
of former and present value can hardly be
ascertained. The fashionable rage for expeditious
travelling, and of being conveyed at the rate of
<span class="smcap lowercase">EIGHT</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">NINE</span> miles an hour from one part of the
kingdom to another, is the absolute furor of the
times, and supported at an immense expence by
those whose peculiar personal pride prompts them
to display the advantages resulting from opulence,
and the privileges from ostentation; to the incessant
misery and premature destruction of thousands,
whose services would be insured <i>for years</i> by a
<span class="pagenum">{424}</span>
more moderate and <span class="smcap lowercase">HUMANE</span> mode of treatment.
The incredible increase of light carriages of every
description, has opened such a field for the use
of horses of airy form, and easy action, that they
are now in eternal request, at more than <i>double</i>,
and in many purchases <span class="smcap lowercase">TREBLE</span>, what they were
to be obtained for no more than twenty years
since.</p>

<p>The different kinds of horses bred for various
purposes, pass under the denomination of
<span class="smcap lowercase">RUNNING HORSES</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTERS</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">CARRIAGE HORSES</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">CART HORSES</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">ROADSTERS</span>,
and <span class="smcap lowercase">HACKS</span>. The first are
propagated in the racing studs of the most opulent
characters, and appropriated entirely to the decision
of sporting engagements upon the <span class="smcap lowercase">TURF</span>;
many of which, after having displayed their
powers in this way, then become <span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTERS</span> of the
<i>first class</i>, and are frequently sold at three and
four hundred guineas each. <span class="smcap">Carriage horses</span>,
with which the gay and fashionable are now
whirled through the western streets of the metropolis
with the most incredible velocity, were formerly
considered the good, safe, substantial <span class="smcap">English hunter</span>,
and might <i>forty years</i> since have been
purchased for thirty or five-and-thirty pounds,
which was at that time about the current value:
they are not <i>now</i>, however, from the constantly
accumulating demand, and incessant destruction, to
be procured in a state of youth and purity, at less
<span class="pagenum">{425}</span>
than nearly <i>three</i> times that sum. <span class="smcap">Cart horses</span> of
great size, strength, and adequate powers, are principally
furnished by the midland and northern
counties, for the coal and corn trade, as well as
the commercial purposes of the city and suburbs,
where they command an incredible price: small
and inferior sorts are bred in, and dispersed
through, almost every other county in the kingdom.
<span class="smcap">Roadsters</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">HACKS</span> may be supposed to
include that great infinity of all sizes, descriptions,
and qualifications, with which every road, every
common, and every pasture, seem so plentifully to
abound.</p>

<p>If superior judgment and circumspection were
ever truly necessary in the selection and purchase
of a <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSE</span>, they are become doubly so, when the
object of pursuit is proportionally difficult of attainment.
To direct the eye, to form the judgment,
and to check the natural impetuosity of the
young and inexperienced purchaser, some few remarks
are indispensibly necessary to shield him
from the rock of fascination, upon which so many
have repentantly foundered. The mind of man
should never be more itself, never more adequate
to the task of cool deliberation and patient observation,
than in the simple examination of a horse
for sale. <span class="smcap">Deception</span> in
<i>dealing</i> is so truly <i>systematic</i>,
and so truly honorable in the present age,
that the mind cannot be too closely fortified for
<span class="pagenum">{426}</span>
all events: whether the subject is to be sold by
<span class="smcap lowercase">AUCTION</span>,
or by <i>private contract</i>, the property of
a <span class="smcap lowercase">GENTLEMAN</span>,
or the offer of a <i>dealer</i>, the ground
of self defence should be precisely the same.</p>

<p>It is the fixed and invariable rule with every
<span class="smcap lowercase">DEALER</span>, to affect,
at <i>first</i>, a perfect indifference respecting
the horse he wishes most to get rid of;
and he always makes a point of never giving the
<i>unequivocal</i> price of any horse till he has been seen
out of the stable; during which time of <i>shewing out</i>,
he, as well as his emissaries and attendants, are occasionally
engaged in watching most attentively
every trait of the intentional purchaser's countenance,
anxious for a single sign of approbation, by
which to regulate the magnitude of his demand;
asking <i>five</i>, <i>ten</i>, <i>fifteen</i>, or <i>twenty</i> guineas more
than he originally intended, in proportion as he
finds the enquirer fascinated with his object of
perfection, and disposed to purchase. Before the
horse is brought out, it is in vain to entreat the
ceremony of "<i>figging</i>" may be dispensed with;
it is declared a <i>custom</i> of <i>honor</i> amongst the fraternity,
and must be complied with.</p>

<p>This prelude performed, and his <i>stern</i> thrown
upon his back like the tail of a squirrel, he is literally
<i>driven</i> into action; the <span class="smcap lowercase">WHIP</span>
(with which he is privately alarmed in his stall twenty times a
day) cannot be permitted to lay dormant even
<span class="pagenum">{427}</span>
upon the present occasion, particularly when its
<i>flaggellating flourish</i> can be displayed to so great
an advantage; the irritating severity of the lash,
so retentively dreaded, he <i>furiously</i> flies from, and
affords an attracting <i>specimen</i> of <i>speed</i> you may
look for in vain upon any future occasion. After
this curious <i>exhibition</i> of his
<span class="smcap lowercase">ACTION</span>, the horse still
trembling with a dread of the <i>deadly instrument</i>
waving in his sight, it will be proper to make a
minute and careful examination of his shape,
make, <span class="smcap lowercase">PROBABLE PERFECTION</span>,
or possible <i>blemishes</i>
and <i>defects</i>, if the horse is permitted by the
<span class="smcap lowercase">DEALER</span>
to stand quiet, a favor which is not <i>always</i> to be
obtained.</p>

<p>This done, place yourself directly opposite to
the horse's head at two yards distance, in which
position, casting your eyes upon his ears, and
dropping them gradually from one point to
another, you command, at a single view, the effect
of his countenance, the <i>good</i> or <i>bad</i> state of
his <span class="smcap lowercase">EYES</span>, the breadth of his breast,
the <i>fate</i> of his
<span class="smcap lowercase">KNEES</span>, the appearance of
<span class="smcap lowercase">SPLENTS</span>, as well as the
growth and uniformity of the <span class="smcap lowercase">FEET</span>. Changing
your place to a side view, at similar distance, you
have there the <i>curve</i> of the <span class="smcap lowercase">CREST</span>,
the circumference
of the <span class="smcap lowercase">BONE</span>, the depth of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">CHEST</span>, the
length of the <span class="smcap lowercase">BACK</span>,
the strength of the <span class="smcap lowercase">LOINS</span>, the
setting on of the <span class="smcap lowercase">TAIL</span>,
and the fashionable finish of
the hind quarter; without which, individually perfect,
<span class="pagenum">{428}</span>
he cannot be in possession of the symmetry
that is known to constitute a handsome and well-bred
horse.</p>

<p>Looking at him <i>behind</i>, it is instantly perceived,
whether he stands well upon his legs, and is formed
wide, firm and muscular across the <span class="smcap lowercase">GASKINS</span>, or
narrow and contracted, bearing what is termed a
"<i>bandy-hocked</i>" or "<i>cat-hammed</i>" appearance. The
same moment affords opportunity to observe, if
<span class="smcap lowercase">BLOOD SPAVINS</span> are perceptible within side,
<span class="smcap lowercase">BONE SPAVINS</span>
without, or <span class="smcap lowercase">CURBS</span> on the back of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">HOCK</span>; as well as
<span class="smcap lowercase">SPLENTS</span> upon any one of the
legs, and whether he cuts either behind or before.
If blood or bone spavin is observed, it is necessary
to recollect (however attracting the object may be
in other respects) they sooner or later produce
<span class="smcap lowercase">LAMENESS</span> to a <i>certainty</i>;
and although they are
not deemed absolutely <i>incurable</i>, they open a field
to the disquietude and anxiety of <span class="smcap lowercase">BLISTERING</span>,
<span class="smcap">firing</span>, &amp;c. with the additional and consolatory
ultimatum of a farrier's bill. <span class="smcap">Splents</span> are by no
means so critical, or dangerous, if seated forward
upon the <i>shank-bone</i>, and not likely to interfere
with, or vibrate in the action of the tendon, passing
under the denomination of the "back sinews;"
in which case, a good and otherways valuable
horse need not be declined for so slight a cause,
where no injury is like to be sustained.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{429}</div>

<p>Having proceeded thus far in the examination
with strict attention, it becomes equally necessary
to descend minutely to the <span class="smcap lowercase">FEET</span>, in search of
<span class="smcap lowercase">CRACKS</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">CORNS</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">THRUSHES</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">COMPRESSION</span> of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">HOOF</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">NARROW HEELS</span>, or fleshy protuberances of
the <i>inner</i>, and consequent projection of the <i>outer
sole</i>. The state of the <span class="smcap lowercase">WIND</span>
is next the object of
enquiry, which is done by making the customary
and critical experiment of pinching the <span class="smcap lowercase">GULLET</span> or
<i>windpipe</i> with considerable force, nearly close to,
and just behind the jaw-bone: should the horse,
upon such pressure, force out a sound substantial
cough, (which is sometimes repeated,) the safety
of the wind is ascertained: on the contrary, should
nothing be produced but a faint hollow wheezing,
with a palpable heaving of the flanks, the state of
the wind may be justly suspected. Should any
doubt arise upon the decision, (which sometimes
happens with the best and most experienced
judges,) let the horse be put into brisk action, and
powerful exertion, when the roaring at a distance,
the laboured respiration, and the preternatural
heaving of the flank, after a brisk gallop of <i>two
thirds</i> of a <span class="smcap lowercase">MILE</span>,
will determine the state of the
wind, without the least chance of being mistaken.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap lowercase">EYES</span>,
that were only superficially noticed
as matter of course in the front view, when the
horse was first brought out of the stable, now become
the necessary objects of minute, patient, and
<span class="pagenum">{430}</span>
judicious investigation. If they are clear, full and
prominent in the orb, reflecting your own figure
from the pupil, without any protrusion of the haw
from the inner corner, any inflammatory enlargement
of the lids, or any acrid weeping from
either, there is then every well-founded reason to
believe they are not only <i>safe</i>, but
<span class="smcap lowercase">GOOD</span>. On the
contrary, should there appear a seeming sinking of
the orbs, with a perceptible indentation, and a
wrinkled contraction above the eyelids, they are
very unfavorable symptoms, indicating impending
ill, and should not be encountered, but with an
expectation of certain loss. A small <i>pig eye</i> should
be examined with great caution; they are better
avoided, if possible, as their future state is not only
to be considered exceedingly doubtful, but they
are always objected to, and productive of vexatious
rebuffs, when a horse is again to be sold. A
cloudy muddiness beneath the outer covering of
the eye, or a milky thickening upon the surface,
denotes present <i>defect</i>, and probability of future
blindness; in all which cases, prudence should prevent
such subject from becoming an object of attraction.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap lowercase">AGE</span>, if asked of a dealer,
is declared "rising
six" or "rising seven;" for it must be held in
remembrance, that their horses are never acknowledged
<i>younger</i> than "<span class="smcap lowercase">FIVE</span>," or
<i>older</i> than "<span class="smcap lowercase">SIX OFF</span>";
and what is still more extraordinary, in addition
<span class="pagenum">{431}</span>
to this <i>convenience</i>, they possess the sole
<span class="smcap lowercase">PATENT</span> for regeneration,
having it always in their
power to make a <i>ten</i> years old horse
<span class="smcap lowercase">SIX</span>, with the
very desirable advantage to a purchaser, that he
shall never be more (<i>by the mouth</i>) so long as he
lives. This extra effort of <span class="smcap lowercase">ART</span>,
or renewal of <i>age</i>,
passes under the denomination of
"<span class="smcap lowercase">BISHOPING</span>,"
(which see,) where a description of the operation
will be found. The <span class="smcap lowercase">AGE</span> of a
<span class="smcap lowercase">HORSE</span> by the mouth is
not dissimilar to abstract points in politics with coffee-house
politicians, <i>largely</i> talked of, but <i>little</i> understood;
which circumstance alone has laid open
a perpetual field for this eternal and remorseless
imposition: to remedy which, as much as the nature
of the case will admit, and that a matter of so
much utility may with very little attention be perfectly
understood, a <span class="smcap lowercase">PLATE</span> is annexed,
and accompanied
with such explanatory matter, as will
render it easy to every comprehension. See
<span class="smcap">Colt</span>.</p>

<p>Having gone through, with precision, all that
can possibly present itself upon the score of examination,
in respect to age, shape, make, figure, and
action, we arrive at the very <i>ultimatum</i> of enquiry,
respecting the <span class="smcap lowercase">WARRANTY</span> of his being perfectly
<span class="smcap lowercase">SOUND</span>. What that warranty is, and how far it is
to <i>extend</i>, requires a more correct and limited line
of certainty than seems at present to be understood.
<span class="smcap lowercase">BLEMISHES</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">DEFECTS</span> are supposed by
<span class="pagenum">{432}</span>
some not to constitute <i>unsoundness</i>, provided the
<span class="smcap lowercase">ACTION</span> of the
horse is not impeded by their appearance;
whilst, on the contrary, it is as firmly urged
by the impartial and disinterested, that no horse
ought to be <i>sold as</i>, or
<span class="smcap lowercase">WARRANTED</span> "perfectly
sound," but in a state of natural and unsullied perfection.
This criterion is the more necessary to be
ascertained, and laid down by some principle of
law, because the numerous litigations in every successive
<span class="smcap lowercase">TERM</span> demonstrate, that various opinions
prevail, according to the <span class="smcap lowercase">INTEREST</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">CAPRICE</span>, or
<span class="smcap lowercase">PECUNIARY</span> convenience, of individuals concerned;
to carry, support and confirm which, even the
prostitution of <span class="smcap lowercase">TRUTH</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">HONOR</span> must become
subservient. And this "glorious uncertainty of
the law" is so clearly comprehended by the Gentlemen
of the Long Robe, that when a <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSE CAUSE</span>
is coming on in any of the Courts, an observation
immediately follows, that "whoever <span class="smcap lowercase">SWEARS</span> the
<i>hardest</i> will obtain it."</p>

<p>To prevent suits of such description, (which
sometimes happen between gentlemen of equal
honor, and strict integrity,) it is much to be wished,
some direct and unequivocal mode of distinction
could be legally ascertained, how far a general
"warranty of soundness" is to extend, and where
the line of perfection or imperfection is to be
drawn; as for instance, to establish, by <span class="smcap lowercase">LAW</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">CUSTOM</span>, some fixed and invariable rules, by which
<span class="pagenum">{433}</span>
the <i>soundness</i> of a horse might so far be insured
between <span class="smcap lowercase">BUYER</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">SELLER</span>, as to render unnecessary
such <span class="smcap lowercase">LAW-SUITS</span> as are invariably supported by
a subornation of perjury on <i>one</i> side or the <i>other</i>.
Nothing, perhaps, could conduce more to a cause
so desirable, or tend more to constitute a criterion
of equity between all parties, if once established,
and mutually understood; that no horse should be
deemed <span class="smcap lowercase">SOUND</span>,
and sold with such <span class="smcap lowercase">WARRANTY</span>,
but in a state of <span class="smcap lowercase">PERFECTION</span>,
entirely free from
<i>lameness</i>, <i>blemish</i>, and <i>defect</i>, not only at the time
of transfer, but never known to have been otherways:
admitting which mode of dealing to form
the basis of equity between one man and another,
an additional observation naturally presents itself,
as a collateral consideration clearly implied, though
not particularly expressed; that a horse sold <i>bona
fide</i> sound, and admitted on both sides to be so at
the time of purchase, should have <i>no</i> right to be
<i>returned</i> under any plea whatever; for it is universally
known, that any horse so sold, must be as
liable to <i>fall lame</i>, become <i>diseased</i>, or even to <i>die</i>,
in <i>one hour</i> after <span class="smcap lowercase">DELIVERY</span>,
as in any other hour of
life. Then where can be the equitable consistency
of returning a horse positively <span class="smcap lowercase">SOUND</span>
when <i>sold</i>,
upon the plea of lameness or disease, when the
time of attack has been merely a matter of chance
between one and the other?</p>

<div class="pagenum">{434}</div>

<p>No juvenile or inexperienced purchaser should
be too eager and hasty in his pursuits, or too easily
<i>fascinated</i> with a seeming object of
<span class="smcap lowercase">GENERAL ATTRACTION</span>.
It is exceedingly easy to purchase "in
<i>haste</i>, and repent at <i>leisure</i>:" none should be instantly
allured by sudden show, and short inspection;
too much trial cannot be obtained, nor
too much patience persevered in during the examination.
The sportsman of prudence, and personal
experience, never even <i>speaks</i> upon the <i>price</i>,
without previously <span class="smcap lowercase">RIDING</span>
the subject in question;
this he does in a remote and quiet situation, then
in a busy one. In the former, mount, dismount,
and mount again; survey and critically examine
him in a state of nature, when calm, and at a distance
from those he knows to be his <i>persecutors</i> as
well <i>in</i> as <i>out</i> of the stable: it is for want of these
precautions, that there are so many dupes to artifice,
who purchase the dullest jades, without adverting
for a moment to the furious effect of
<span class="smcap lowercase">WHIP</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">SPUR</span>,
and <i>ginger</i>; the dealer's best friends.</p>

<p>As it is by no means a proof of judgment to purchase
<i>hastily</i>, so, having once purchased, it should
be an invariable maxim never to part too rashly.
Innumerable are the instances where horses have
been disposed of in the moments of caprice, and
precipitately sold for <i>fifteen</i>, <i>twenty</i>, or <i>thirty</i>
pounds, that have afterwards produced an hundred
or an hundred and fifty guineas. When a horse of
<span class="pagenum">{435}</span>
promising appearance, and pleasing action, is rode
upon trial, great allowance should be made for the
state of his mouth: he may not only have been accustomed
to a different <i>bit</i> or <span class="smcap lowercase">BRIDLE</span>, but may
probably have been some time ridden by a <i>previous</i>
<span class="smcap lowercase">OWNER</span> of very different
<i>temper</i> and <i>disposition</i>.
One man rides with a <i>tight</i>, another with a <i>slack</i>
rein: one is a petulant, refractory, impatient rider,
who not unfrequently makes his horse so by his
<i>own</i> indiscretion; when, on the contrary, a mild,
serene, and philosophic rider (who ruminates upon
the imperfections of the animal he bestrides, as
well as his own) often enjoys the inexpressible satisfaction
of making a convert to his own good usage
and sensibility; constituting, by such patient perseverance,
that very horse a desirable object of acquisition,
even to those who had, upon too slight a
foundation, or too short a trial, discarded him as
unworthy any service at all.</p>

<p>Experience affords ample demonstration, that
the <i>tempers</i> of <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSES</span>
are as much diversified as
the tempers of those who <span class="smcap lowercase">RIDE</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">DRIVE</span> them; and
it will not be inapplicable for the <i>young</i> to be <i>told</i>,
or the <span class="smcap lowercase">OLD</span> to <i>recollect</i>,
that a great number of
horses are made <i>restive</i> and <i>vicious</i> by ill usage, and
then unmercifully <i>whipped</i>, <i>spurred</i>, and <i>beaten</i> for
being so; in corroboration of which fact, there are
numbers constantly disposed of "to the best
bidder," as invincibly restive, at the <i>hammer</i> of a
<span class="pagenum">{436}</span>
<span class="smcap lowercase">REPOSITORY</span>, that would in a few weeks,
by gentle and humane treatment, have been reformed to the
best tempers, and most pliable dispositions. Those
who have been most attentively accurate in observation
and experience, well know, that personal
severity to horses for <i>restiveness</i> or <i>starting</i>, very
frequently makes them <i>worse</i>, but is seldom found
to make them <i>better</i>: it is, therefore, certainly more
rational, more humane, and evidently more gratifying,
to effect subservience by tenderness and
manly perseverance (divested of pusillanimity and
fear) than by means of unnatural severity, often
tending to render "the remedy worse than the
disease."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horses</span>, when at liberty, and in a state of freedom,
although they are exposed to the different
degrees of <i>heat</i> and <i>cold</i>, (encountering the utmost
<i>severity</i> of the <span class="smcap lowercase">ELEMENTS</span>
in opposite seasons,) are
well known to be in more constant health, and less
subject to morbidity, than when destined to the
scanty confines of a <span class="smcap lowercase">STABLE</span>,
and brought into <span class="smcap lowercase">USE</span>;
the causes of which are too numerous, and too extensive,
to come within the limits of a work of this
kind. It is, however, to be presumed, very many
of the <span class="smcap lowercase">SEVERE</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">DANGEROUS</span>, and, finally, <i>destructive</i>
disorders to which they are so constantly subject,
and so perpetually liable, are produced much more
by a want of care and attention in those who
<span class="smcap lowercase">OWN</span>
or <i>superintend</i> them, than to any pre-disposing tendency
<span class="pagenum">{437}</span>
in the animal to disease. In farther elucidation
of which, see "<span class="smcap">Groom</span>."</p>

<p>The disorders to which horses are perpetually
incident, may be reduced to a few distinct heads,
as the acute, chronic, dangerous, infectious, and
accidental; the major part of those partaking of a
joint description, and technical complication. For
instance, staggers, flatulent or inflammatory cholic,
fevers, pleurisy, inflammation of the lungs, and
strangury, may be ranked amongst the acute and
dangerous. <span class="smcap">Glanders</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">FARCY</span> are admitted to
be <i>infectious</i>, and in advanced stages, <i>incurable</i>.
The <span class="smcap lowercase">GREASE</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">SURFEIT</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">MANGE</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">ASTHMA</span>, &amp;c. may
be termed <i>chronic</i>. Accidents and incidents include
colds, coughs, swelled legs, cracked heels, wind-galls,
strains, warbles, sitfasts, and a long train of
trifles, by far the greater part of which originate
in carelessness, inhumanity, and indiscretion. A
description of all will be found under their distinct
heads; and the means of alleviation and cure must
be derived from the most popular practitioners, or
the works of those who have written professedly
upon the subject of <span class="smcap">Veterinary Medicine</span> and
<span class="smcap">Disease</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horses</span> having for so many centuries continued
to increase the ease, comfort, pleasure, and happiness,
of all descriptions of people, they have at
length, by the fertile invention of national financiers,
<span class="pagenum">{438}</span>
been found equally capable of becoming materially
instrumental to the support of Government,
in a degree beyond what the utmost effusions of
fancy could have formed, as will be seen by the
very judicious scale of gradational taxation, accurately
copied and annexed. And as there was no
other distinct head, where the <span class="smcap lowercase">DUTIES</span>
upon <span class="smcap lowercase">CARRIAGES</span>
could with propriety be introduced, they
are here included also, as no inapplicable addition
to requisite information, in which so many are individually
concerned.</p>

<h3>HORSE-DEALERS</h3><p>—are persons who derive
their subsistence, and obtain a livelihood, by buying
and selling of horses only; and these were become
so numerous in both town and country, that,
either to restrain the number, or to render the occupation
proportionally serviceable to the exigencies
of the State, the following duties have been
imposed. Every Person exercising the trade or
business of a <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSE-DEALER</span>,
must pay <span class="smcap lowercase">ANNUALLY</span>,
if within London, Westminster, the Parishes of
St. Mary-le-Bone, and St. Pancras, in Middlesex,
<span class="pagenum">{440}</span>
the weekly Bills of Mortality, or the Borough of
Southwark, 10<i>l.</i> In any other Part of Great
Britain, 5<i>l.</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Horse dealers</span> shall cause the words
"<span class="smcap">Licenced to deal in Horses</span>,"
to be painted or written in
large and legible Characters, either on a Sign hung
out, or on some visible Place in the Front of their
House, Gateway, or Stables; and if he shall sell
any Horse without fixing such Token, he shall
forfeit 10<i>l.</i> to be recovered by Action; Half to
the King, and Half to the Informer. 36th George
Third, c. xvii.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>HORSEMANSHIP</h3><p>—is the act of riding with
ease, grace, and fortitude. It may be taken in
two points of view; as those who, self-taught, become
proficients equally with those who derive
instruction from the <span class="smcap lowercase">SCHOOLS</span>,
of which there are
many of established celebrity. Doubts, however,
have arisen, and opposite opinions have been supported,
whether the sportsman who has acquired
the art from nature, habit, and practice, is not,
in general, a more easy, graceful, expert, and
courageous horseman, than the major part of those
who have been in the <i>trammels</i> (and riding the
great horse) of the most able and eminent professors.
As there are but few of these schools, except
in the metropolis, and excellent horsemen to
be seen in every part of the kingdom, that circumstance
<span class="pagenum">{441}</span>
alone seems to justify the presumption, that
there is much more of <span class="smcap lowercase">NATURE</span> than
of <i>art</i> in the
acquisition. However unnecessary the instructions
of a <span class="smcap lowercase">RIDING MASTER</span>
may be in forming the qualifications
and graces of a <span class="smcap lowercase">FOXHUNTER</span>, they become
indispensibly requisite to the completion of a
<span class="smcap lowercase">MILITARY EDUCATION</span>,
in which personal dignity, and
adequate authority, must be properly and systematically

<p>Previous to every other consideration in the art
of horsemanship, it is necessary to be well acquainted
with every minute circumstance, and regular
routine, of stable discipline; to know the
name and use of every utensil; to comprehend the
application of every distinct part of the apparatus
with which a horse is caparisoned, and to understand
perfectly the property of each kind of bridle,
and the effect they are individually calculated to
produce. These are conjunctively of such material
import to safety, and such palpable proofs of judicious
arrangement and solid judgment, that they
may, in the aggregate, be considered the very
foundation upon which the reputation of a
<span class="smcap lowercase">HORSEMAN</span>
is to be formed. Preparatory to mounting, particularly
for a journey, or the chase, the experienced
<span class="smcap lowercase">SPORTSMAN</span>,
feeling for the frailties and inadvertencies
of human nature, never trusts too much to
the hands and eyes of <i>others</i>, when not deprived of
the use of his <span class="smcap lowercase">OWN</span>;
but prudently condescends to
<span class="pagenum">{442}</span>
examine, by the glance of an eye, how far the
horse, and appendages, are adequate to the purpose
in which he is then going to engage.</p>

<p>This being done, he comes gently up to his
horse, opposite the shoulder, on the <i>near</i> (that is
the left) side: when facing the wither, he takes the
reins of the bridle with a tuft of the mane firmly in
his left hand, and of about the same length they are
held in when mounted. The horse standing still,
(which he should always be accustomed to do when
mounting,) and not <i>before</i>, the right-hand is employed
in supporting the stirrup on that side, for
the reception of the left foot; when which is safely
inserted, the right-hand is removed from the stirrup
to the hinder part of the saddle, where it forms a
support or lever to assist in raising the right leg
from the ground, and to pass it gradually and
steadily over the body of the horse, where it falls
readily into contact with the stirrup on that side.
When first the reins are taken in hand, due observance
should be made of the medium they are
to be held in; that is, not <i>tight</i> enough to make
the horse uneasy, and to run back, or <i>slack</i> enough
to afford him an opportunity to <i>set off</i> before his
rider is firmly <span class="smcap lowercase">SEATED</span>.</p>

<p>When mounted, the body should be easily and
pliably erect, inclining rather backwards than forwards;
the weight entirely resting upon the posteriors,
<span class="pagenum">{443}</span>
proportionally relieved by the continuation
of the thighs, and an equal moderate pressure of
both the legs upon the sides of the horse. To preserve
which position free from constraint and stiffness,
the proper <i>length</i> of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">STIRRUPS</span> is a matter
most material to be attended to; for unless they are
in <i>length</i> adapted to the <i>stature</i> of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">RIDER</span>, it will
be impracticable for him to keep a firm and graceful
seat, particularly with <i>violent</i>, <i>vicious</i>, or <i>restive</i>
horses, upon many emergencies. The general
error, particularly with inexperienced horsemen,
who have never been accustomed to ride in the
early part of life, is having their stirrups ridiculously
<i>short</i>, by which they injudiciously conceive
they insure their own personal safety; though the
opposite is the fact, and with a spirited horse they
are always in greater danger; for the knees being
lifted above the skirt of the saddle, the thighs are
rendered useless, the legs are deprived of their necessary
assistance, the rider is left without a seat or
fulcrum to sustain his position, and <i>rocking</i> first on
one side, then <i>swinging</i> on the other, he is left entirely
at the mercy of his horse. That this may be
the better reconciled to every comprehension, the
stirrups, for ease and safety, should be exactly
in this state; that the rider sitting upon his horse
(either still or in action) should be able to disengage
his foot from the stirrup at a single motion,
and by keeping his foot in a direct horizontal position,
would have the command and power of recovering
<span class="pagenum">{444}</span>
or catching the stirrup almost instantaneously,
with the slightest effort for that purpose.</p>

<p>These remarks, properly attended to, the body
will be found easy, firm, and commanding; divested
of all those <i>rockings</i>, <i>jerkings</i>, and <i>twistings</i>,
sometimes over the horse's <i>head</i>, at others over his
<i>tail</i>, displaying the <span class="smcap lowercase">FEATS</span>
of an <i>involuntary</i> attitudinarian,
seldom seen but in <span class="smcap">Hyde Park</span>, or the <i>environs</i>
of the <span class="smcap">Metropolis</span>. The left-hand is termed
the <i>bridle-hand</i>, and the left elbow must come
nearly into gentle contact with the body, which it
has always for its support in any sudden <i>jump</i>,
<i>start</i>, or <i>stumble</i>, of the horse; in want of which
regular bearing (if required) the hand could not be
always equally steady, and would of course frequently,
but unintentionally, prove a check to the
horse. It is impossible to lay down fixed and invariable
rules for the precise distance of the left-hand
from the breast, or its heighth from the saddle;
horses differ so much in their <span class="smcap lowercase">MOUTHS</span>, that
the bridle-hand must be used <i>higher</i> or <i>lower</i>, and
the reins <i>longer</i> or <i>shorter</i> in proportion. The
right-hand (termed, in racing, the whip-hand)
should be held in a kind of corresponding uniformity
with the left, acting also occasionally in the
use of the reins, and the management of the mouth;
and this is the more necessary, as every complete
<span class="smcap lowercase">HORSEMAN</span>, or perfect
<span class="smcap lowercase">SPORTSMAN</span>, can manage the
<span class="pagenum">{445}</span>
reins (of even a <i>run-away</i> horse) as well with <i>one</i>
hand as the <i>other</i>.</p>

<p>The hand should always be firm, but delicately
pliable, feelingly alive to every motion of the
mouth; for, by <i>giving</i> and taking properly, the
horse has better opportunity to display his spirit,
and demonstrate the pleasure he receives, in being
encouraged to champ upon the bit. As the necessary
qualifications which constitute the excellence
of horsemanship can never be derived from <i>theory</i>,
and are only to be acquired by <span class="smcap lowercase">PRACTICE</span>,
it becomes concisely applicable to make such remarks,
and inculcate such general instructions, as may be
usefully retained in the memory of those, who, not
feeling themselves too confident in their own ability,
are content to avail themselves of information
resulting from an experience of which they
are not yet in possession. After all the trouble and
expence of breaking horses, by the best and most
expert professors in that way, yet there are numbers
possess, by nature, and retain by habit and
temper, faults and vices, not only unpleasant and
inconvenient, but even unsafe and dangerous, to
those who ride them. An impetuous, ill-tempered
rider, who is always expecting his horse to
do more than nature ever intended, will soon make
the animal as petulant and refractory as himself:
few passionate riders become <i>good</i> and <i>humane</i>
horsemen; great patience, serenity, and some philosophy,
<span class="pagenum">{446}</span>
is required to meet the variegated and
unexpected vicissitudes unavoidably to be encountered
in the field, as well as upon the road.</p>

<p>A hot, high-spirited horse, and a fiery, petulant
rider, constitute a paradoxical, heterogeneous connection;
for as they support a perpetual war between
them, and neither feels disposed to submit,
so they continue to irritate and render each other
worse than they were before. A horse, from natural
sagacity, soon discovers the mildness and placidity
of his rider, proportioning his own obedience
and docility accordingly; of which greater
proof need not be adduced, than his absolutely
following the master or servant from whom he receives
good usage, as well as his being left at
different doors totally <i>unconfined</i>, in the midst of
populous streets, and thronged with carriages,
from whence he will not attempt to stir, till removed
by the voice or hand to which he belongs.
Horsemen of tenderness and reflection are ever attentive
to the animal who contributes so much to
their own health, happiness, or emolument; and
omit no one opportunity, that presents itself, of
promoting their ease and comfort in return. If
the horse, from natural shyness and timidity, or
probably from ill usage in the possession of a
former master, is alarmed at the sight or motion of
<i>stick</i> or <i>whip</i>, a rider of this description quiets his
fears, by letting it gradually decline behind his
<span class="pagenum">{447}</span>
own thigh near the flank of the horse: the <i>fool</i>, or
the <i>madman</i>, brandishes it before his eyes, in confirmation
of his own ignorance or insanity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horses</span> who are addicted to <i>starting</i>,
do it from fear, and not from opposition; the recollection of
which should instantly excite a consideration of
pity and tenderness in the rider; but it is much to
be regretted, so great is the depravity of the human
mind, that nine times out of ten, this very
fear (the palpable effect of constitutional timidity)
is productive of the most <i>severe</i> and <i>unmerited</i>
punishment. It is no uncommon thing to see a
much greater brute than the animal he bestrides,
most unmercifully <i>beating</i>, <i>whipping</i>, and <i>spurring</i>,
a poor creature, for possessing a sensation in
common with ourselves. If every one of the human
species were to be beat, bruised, and crippled,
for being justly alarmed at the appearance of danger,
or the sight of unnatural and unexpected objects
of surprize, our hospitals could never prove
sufficiently capacious to receive <i>half</i> the patients
that would be daily presented for admission. If
caution, and the apprehension of danger, is thus instinctively
interwoven with the very frame of <span class="smcap lowercase">MAN</span>,
is it not natural that the <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSE</span>
(who has likewise
the power of seeing, hearing, and feeling) may be
equally alarmed at, and afraid of, impending destruction?
Will any, but the most incredulous
<span class="smcap lowercase">STOIC</span>, presume to argue, or to doubt,
that the <span class="pagenum">{448}</span>
horse has not the same susceptibility of pain, and
the same dread of dissolution, as ourselves? Has
he not the same degree of precaution and circumspection
in avoiding calamity when it depends upon
himself? Has he not the same fear of being crushed
to atoms by the weight of any superior power suspended
above himself? Has he not the same fear
of being drowned? Is he not equally alarmed if
even gently led to the brink of an awful precipice,
and does he not instantly retreat with horror? Is he
not terrified, even to a deprivation of motion, at
the sight of fire? Why then can it create surprize,
that he should be afraid of, and alarmed at, a
high-loaded broad-wheel waggon upon a narrow
road, whose ponderous summit seems to threaten
his probable and speedy annihilation?</p>

<p>If then it is thus clearly demonstrated, and must
be candidly admitted, that the true cause of a
horse's <span class="smcap lowercase">STARTING</span> is <i>fear</i>,
what magical effect is
<i>violence</i> on the part of the rider to produce? Nothing
can more forcibly evince the <i>passion</i>, <i>folly</i>,
<i>ignorance</i>, and <i>inhumanity</i>, of the lower classes,
than the prevalence of this practice. That horses
may be made to pass objects of dislike and dread
by such means is not to be disputed; it is only
presumed that lenity, patience, and mild persuasion,
are the most preferable, and by far the most
gentleman-like of the two. It is the business of
the rider to conquer, and become master of his
<span class="pagenum">{449}</span>
horse; but violent passion, and coercive measures,
need not be resorted to, till the more lenient attempts
have failed. Notwithstanding the idea here
inculcated, of not <i>violently</i> and <i>suddenly</i> pressing a
horse up to a carriage, waggon, or any other object
at which he has started, it is necessary he should
be made to know he <i>must pass it</i>, which he may be
made to do by a modulated tone of the voice, a
moderate and judicious use of the rein, and a
proper pressure of one or both legs, as well, <i>or
better</i>, than by any forcible means whatever.</p>

<p>The use of the <span class="smcap lowercase">LEGS</span>
is a very important consideration,
not only in the due correction of a
<span class="smcap lowercase">HORSE</span> that starts, but in the
<span class="smcap lowercase">AIRS</span> taught in the
<span class="smcap lowercase">MANEGE</span>;
where the horse is supported and helped
by the <i>hands</i> and <i>legs</i> in every action required,
from whence he is technically said to perform his
airs by <span class="smcap lowercase">AIDS</span> from the rider.
When a horse, in starting, begins to fly on one side, for the purpose
of turning from the object he wishes to avoid,
the instantaneous, strong and sudden pressure of
the leg on that side counteracts his spring, and,
with the joint exertion of the rein and wrist, immediately
brings him straight; at which moment,
the same use being made of both legs, as was just
before made with one, he has no alternative, but
to submit to the determined correction, and soon
passes the object of dread or dislike, and proceeds
in the way he is required. As the legs are of great
<span class="pagenum">{450}</span>
utility in the <span class="smcap lowercase">PROPER</span>
management of a horse, so
they are the very reverse, if <i>improperly</i> brought
into action. Nothing sooner denotes the inability
of a rider, than to see the legs swinging like a
pendulum, and alternately beating against the sides
of the horse: if he is a spirited horse, and well
broke, he conceives himself intentionally excited
to brisker action; if, on the contrary, he is a dull
and sluggish goer, it only adds to his habitual callosity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humanity</span> having been already mentioned as
one of the leading qualifications necessary to constitute
the character of a perfect <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSEMAN</span>, or true
<span class="smcap lowercase">SPORTSMAN</span>, (which are nearly synonimous),
it invariably prompts each to insure, upon all occasions,
the necessary comforts for his <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSE</span>,
before he
bestows a single thought upon his <i>own</i>. It has
been wisely observed, that the man who rides <i>fast</i>
without a <i>motive</i>, never affords himself time for
reflection; and that he who is always in a
<span class="smcap lowercase">GALLOP</span>,
is either a <i>fool</i> or a <i>madman</i>. These remarks probably
originated in an observation resulting from
experience, and tolerably correct in the application;
that those who ride <i>hardest</i>, are generally the
most indifferent about the <span class="smcap lowercase">CARE</span>
of their <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSES</span>.
Those who act prudently, and with a proper attention
to their own interest, will occasionally condescend
to take a survey of the stable management
within, as well as the enjoyment of pleasure without;
<span class="pagenum">{451}</span>
upon the old and well-founded maxim, that
"the master's eye makes the work light;" with the
additional advantage of most probably keeping
disease at a distance. The same degree of discretion
which regulates the conduct of the young and
inexperienced <span class="smcap lowercase">SPORTSMAN</span> in one respect,
will regulate it in another: having the health and safety
of his horse at heart, he will never hurry him for
the first hour in the morning, till time and gentle
action has enabled him to unload his carcase; he
will never make unreasonably long stages upon
the <span class="smcap lowercase">ROAD</span>; ride races, or take
<i>unnecessary leaps</i> in
the <span class="smcap lowercase">FIELD</span>:
at the conclusion of the <span class="smcap lowercase">JOURNEY</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">CHASE</span>, he will see,
that whatever he may think
necessary to be done, is so, without implicitly relying
upon <i>imaginary</i> punctuality, in ordering it
to be done by <span class="smcap lowercase">OTHERS</span>.
These suggestions, however,
apply more to <span class="smcap lowercase">INNS</span>
upon the <i>road</i>, and the
<span class="smcap lowercase">LIVERY STABLES</span> in the
<span class="smcap lowercase">METROPOLIS</span>, than to the
private stables, and regular establishments, of
gentlemen having servants of reputation, upon
whose fidelity they can fix a firm reliance.</p>

<h3>HORSE-RACING</h3><p>—has been a favorite sport
with the superior classes for many centuries, but
never arrived at any degree of local celebrity till
the reign of <span class="smcap">Charles</span> the
<span class="smcap">Second</span>; who, entering
into the spirit of the <span class="smcap lowercase">TURF</span>,
and becoming personally
present with the full splendor of his court,
then laid the foundation of the meetings at <span class="smcap">Newmarket</span>,
which are now become so justly eminent,
and where <span class="smcap lowercase">RACING</span> has long since
attained the full zenith of perfection. This sport during so many
years, had undergone a variety of changes and depressions,
according to the temper of the times,
the dispositions of the people, and the fluctuation
of events; amidst all which, it seems to have been
the peculiar province of the great <span class="smcap">Duke</span> of
<span class="smcap">Cumberland</span>
(uncle of his present Majesty) to have
become the principal instrument of renovation;
having, by incessant exertion, and personal example,
raised the spirit of the <span class="smcap lowercase">TURF</span> to a degree of
eminence and emulation, the brilliant rays of
which will most probably never be totally obscured,
till "time itself shall be no more." This,
however, was not effected without an immensity
of expence, and an incredible succession of
<span class="smcap lowercase">LOSSES</span>,
to the <i>sharks</i>, <i>Greeks</i>, and <i>black-legs</i> of that time,
by whom his Royal Highness was eternally surrounded,
and incessantly pillaged; but having, in
the greatness of his mind, the military maxim of
"persevere and conquer," he was not to be deterred
from the object of pursuit, till, having just
<span class="pagenum">{453}</span>
become possessor of the best <span class="smcap lowercase">STOCK</span>,
best <span class="smcap lowercase">BLOOD</span>,
and most numerous <span class="smcap lowercase">STUD</span> in the kingdom,
beating his opponents "at all points," he suddenly "passed
that bourne from whence no traveller returns;" an
irreparable loss to the <span class="smcap lowercase">TURF</span>,
and universally lamented by the kingdom at large.</p>

</div>

<p>This unexpected and severe stroke occasioned a
temporary stagnation; and the general gloom, with
which all the interested were for some time affected,
seemed to threaten a serious suspension, if
not a total annihilation; but the <span class="smcap lowercase">STUD</span>
being announced for <span class="smcap lowercase">SALE</span>
at the <span class="smcap lowercase">GREAT LODGE</span>
in <span class="smcap">Windsor Park</span>,
it afforded scope for the most <i>fertile</i> speculations,
and those who had lost (by the Duke's
death) the most striking and opulent object of their
depredations, now found it prudent to form themselves
into a <i>family</i> combination and compact, by
whose <i>indefatigable industry</i> the sporting part of the
public were most shamefully robbed for five-and-twenty
years, at all the races of note for fifty
miles round London; when finding, in their own
phrase, that "the <span class="smcap lowercase">GAME</span> was
<i>quite up</i>," their persons
were known, and their practices exploded, they
disposed of the <span class="smcap lowercase">FAMILY STUD</span>,
withdrawing themselves
as <span class="smcap lowercase">PRINCIPALS</span>,
and acting only as <i>accessories</i>
upon <i>private</i> information from the subordinates,
upon which the experience of years has proved a
handsome subsistence is to be obtained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">{454}</span>
These discoveries in almost every direction,
roused gentlemen of <span class="smcap lowercase">FORTUNE</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">HONOR</span>, and
<span class="smcap lowercase">INTEGRITY</span>,
from the apathy to which they had been
inadvertently lulled; and seeing the absolute necessity
of a separation from a set of <i>marked</i> unprincipled
miscreants, proper means of exclusion
were adopted, the <span class="smcap lowercase">RULES</span> of the
<span class="smcap">Jockey Club</span>
(which see) were revised and improved; every
proper mode being taken to prevent the introduction
and election of those, whose characters and
property were not known to accord with the principles
of the original institution. Here followed
another temporary gloom; the deaths of several of
the most zealous amateurs and supporters of the
turf, in almost immediate succession, caused such a
general <i>sterility</i>, that <span class="smcap">Newmarket</span>
was literally in
<i>mourning</i>; training-grooms and stable-lads were
daily becoming gentlemen at large (or rather <i>wanderers</i>)
for want of employment. As casual circumstances
frequently effect <span class="smcap lowercase">CONTRASTS</span>, or operate
by <span class="smcap lowercase">EXTREMES</span>, so,
during the last twelve or fourteen
years, <span class="smcap lowercase">RACING</span>
has experienced another resurrection;
but <span class="smcap lowercase">DEATH</span>, that unrelenting "leveller of
all distinctions," has recently deprived us of some
of its most experienced devotees, whose
<span class="smcap lowercase">STUDS</span> of
course are successively coming to the hammer, and
indicate at present no certain prospect of increasing
popularity. As this subject will be repeatedly
treated on, under those heads to which it particularly
appertains, it becomes only necessary to introduce

who wins <span class="smcap lowercase">ONE</span>.</p>

<p>For the <span class="smcap lowercase">BEST</span> of the

<p><span class="smcap">Bets</span> agreed to be paid or received in town, or

<p>If a <span class="smcap lowercase">MATCH</span>

<p>The person who lays the <span class="smcap lowercase">ODDS</span>,
has a right to

<p>When a person has chosen his horse, the field is
what starts against him; but there is no field, if the

the <span class="smcap lowercase">PLATE</span> is
<span class="smcap lowercase">WON</span>, if that heat is not mentioned at
the time of betting.</p>

<p>Where a <span class="smcap lowercase">PLATE</span> is won by <i>two heats</i>,
the preference of the horses is determined by the places
they are in at the termination of the second heat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horses</span> running on the wrong side of a
<span class="smcap lowercase">POST</span>,

<p>Horses <i>drawn</i> between any of the heats, before
the plate is <span class="smcap lowercase">WON</span>, are distanced.</p>

cross and jostle, when the <span class="smcap lowercase">ARTICLES</span>
do not permit it.</p>

<p>If a horse <span class="smcap lowercase">WINS</span> the first heat,
and all others

are distanced.</p>

<p>When <span class="smcap lowercase">BETS</span> are made after a heat
upon a subsequent
event, if the horse so betted upon does not
start, the <span class="smcap lowercase">BETS</span> so made are <i>void</i>.</p>

<p>When three horses have <span class="smcap lowercase">EACH</span>
won a <span class="smcap lowercase">HEAT</span>, they
only must start for a fourth, and the preference between
them will be determined by it, there having
before been no difference between them.</p>

<p>No horse can be distanced in a fourth heat.</p>

<p>When the words "<i>play or pay</i>" are included in
a <span class="smcap lowercase">BET</span>, it is thus decided:
the horse which does not
appear, and be ready to start, at the time appointed,
is the <i>loser</i>; and the other is the
<span class="smcap lowercase">WINNER</span>,
although he goes over the Course by himself.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{462}</div>

<p>In running heats, if it cannot be decided which
is <i>first</i>, the heat is then called a
<span class="smcap lowercase">DEAD HEAT</span>, and
they may all start again; unless it should happen
in the <i>last</i> heat, and then it must be between the
two horses which, if <i>either</i> had
<span class="smcap lowercase">WON</span>, the race
would have been decided; but if between two,
that by either winning the race would not have
been determined, then it is no heat, and the others
may all start again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bets</span> made upon horses

<p>The New Roundabout  Course on the Flat is
nearly a mile and three quarters.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{464}</div>

<p>The great and leading qualification of a horse
bred for the <span class="smcap lowercase">TURF</span>, is the purity of his blood,
which can only be insured by the verity of his
<span class="smcap lowercase">PEDIGREE</span>, and this, to be authentic, must be signed
by the <span class="smcap lowercase">BREEDER</span>, and is in purchase and sale always
transferred with the horse. The most distinguishing
trait of judgment in racing, is first to ascertain
the exact speed of the horse, and then to discover
of what precise weight he is master; that he may
not be retarded in one, by being overloaded with
the other. Attentive experience with the <span class="smcap lowercase">PROFESSORS</span>
and <span class="smcap lowercase">AMATEURS</span> for a series of years, has long
since fully demonstrated, upon practical proof, (for
the trials have been repeatedly made even to the
<i>key</i> of the stable-<i>door</i>,) that the celerity is, in certain
degrees, to be increased or impeded by the
weight the horse has to carry. It will, therefore,
be readily conceived, if two horses are tolerably
equal in speed, strength, blood, and bone, as well
as of the same year, the horse which carries the
least weight by only <i>three pounds</i>, must, in the
course of <span class="smcap lowercase">FOUR MILES</span>, display the advantage he
has over his antagonist; particularly as the longer
the race, the more will the horse be affected by the
weight he carries; and those who are the best and
most experienced judges, hesitate not to affirm,
that the addition of <i>seven pounds</i> weight carried by
one, where both are thought of equal speed, will,
if the ground is run honestly over, make the difference
of a <span class="smcap lowercase">DISTANCE</span> (two hundred and forty yards)
in the four miles only.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{465}</div>

<p>The racing weights most in use for half a century
past, have been according to age and qualifications,
from about seven stone seven, to nine
stone twelve, or ten stone; except in matches with
two years old, and yearlings at light or <i>feather</i>
weights, and the <span class="smcap">King's hundreds</span>, for which
(till some trifling alterations lately adopted) they
carried at six years old <span class="smcap lowercase">TWELVE STONE</span>.
There are,
however, some <span class="smcap lowercase">NEW CLUBS</span>,
lately instituted by
<span class="smcap lowercase">NOBLEMEN</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">GENTLEMEN</span> of the first distinction,
who hold their meetings at <span class="smcap">Bibury</span> and
<span class="smcap">Kingscote</span>, in Gloucestershire, where the weights
are advanced beyond former example to twelve or
thirteen stone, upon a well-founded principle of
exciting emulation in <span class="smcap lowercase">BREEDERS</span>
to pay some attention
to <span class="smcap lowercase">BONE</span> as well as to
<span class="smcap lowercase">BLOOD</span>; a most judicious
and salutary improvement, considering the infinity
of <i>weeds</i> that are annually drafted and destined to
the hammer of a repository, as objects of neither
value, utility, or attraction.</p>

generally termed a callosity, or an ossification
just below it. The phrase, however, is
now considered entirely obsolete; and the distinction

<span class="smcap lowercase">BONE SPAVIN</span>, or
<span class="smcap lowercase">CURB</span>, as the case may happen to be.</p>

<h3>HOUNDS</h3><p>—are the well-known objects of
<span class="smcap lowercase">SPORTING ATTRACTION</span>
from one extremity of the
kingdom to another; possessing within themselves
a fascinating power, or exhilarating property, to
which all liberal minds, of congenial sensibility, become
imperceptibly and irresistibly subdued; forming
that kind of inexplicable temptation, that indescribable
vibration of pleasure upon human irritability,
that none but those of the most stoical
apathy, the greatest mental fortitude, or personal
self-denial, can summon sufficient resolution to
avoid.</p>

</div>

<div class="pagenum">{470}</div>

<p>The great variety of hounds with which the
country formerly abounded, seem now, by the
judicious crosses of succeeding generations, to have
been principally reduced to a much more contracted
point of view, and center entirely in the
denomination of <span class="smcap lowercase">STAG</span> hounds,
<span class="smcap lowercase">FOX</span> hounds,
<span class="smcap lowercase">HARRIERS</span>,
and <span class="smcap lowercase">BEAGLES</span>; each of the four being a
degree less in size than the other, with such variations
in strength, speed, colour, and tongue, as
may have been adopted by the judgment or fancy
of the <span class="smcap lowercase">BREEDER</span>.
We have been taught, by a
maxim of long standing, to believe, "there is no
rule without an exception." An author of much
celebrity, however, in respect to the breeding of
hounds, pays due respect to rule, but does not
advert to exception. It is his opinion, "that
there are necessary points in the shape of a hound,
which ought always to be attended to; for if he
be not of a perfect symmetry, he will neither run
fast, nor bear much work: he has much to undergo,
and should have strength proportioned to
it. Let his legs be straight as arrows; his feet
round, and not too large; his shoulders back; his
breast rather wide than narrow; his chest deep;
his back broad; his head small; his neck thin; his
tail thick and brushy; if he carry it well, so much
the better."</p>

<p>Without animadverting upon the <span class="smcap lowercase">SIZE</span>
of any particular kind of hound, as applicable to any particular
<span class="pagenum">{471}</span>
sort of chase, or to any particular kind
of country, but with a view to the aggregate in
a general sense, there are, as in all other matters
of <span class="smcap lowercase">FANCY</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">FASHION</span>, or
<span class="smcap lowercase">CAPRICE</span>, a variety of opinions.
Some there are who profess themselves
strenuous advocates for what they term the "busy
bustlers," or small hounds, upon a plea, that they
are always at work, lose no time, climb hills fast
enough for any horse, and get through coverts
quicker than any other. Sportsmen of a bolder description
are equally strenuous, and perhaps with a
greater shew of reason, in the support of large
hounds, justly affirming, they will make their way
in any country, get better through the dirt than a
small one; and that their pursuit can be but little
obstructed by whatever fence may present itself in
the course of the chase.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Beckford</span>,
whose opinion, and perfect practical
knowledge of the subject, has been implicitly
bowed to, and acquiesced in, by the best and
most experienced judges in the kingdom, has
given a decided preference to "hounds of a
<span class="smcap lowercase">MIDDLE SIZE</span>;" saying,
"he believes all animals
of that description are the strongest and best able
to bear fatigue;" in corroboration of which he
quotes from <span class="smcap">Somerville</span>, as would have been
also done in this place, in confirmation of the same
opinion.</p>

<p>Next to the consideration of <span class="smcap lowercase">SIZE</span>
and <span class="smcap lowercase">SYMMETRY</span>
(whatever that may be) should follow a corresponding
uniformity of the whole. A pack, to
be handsome, should vary little or none in height,
and have a pleasing affinity to each other in colour:
to be good, they should run well together;
and the unison of their musical tongues should
constitute a perfect harmony, without a single note
of discord. It is well known, that it is not always
the lot of the most complete and best selected
packs to kill in proportion to their seeming
excellence; some are very much superior in qualifications
to what they may promise to a stranger at
<i>first</i> view; for though of various sizes, and picked
up in different counties, (as well as from the hammer,)
without the least appearance of consanguinity,
or one distinguishing trait of attraction,
yet they seldom miss their game. <span class="smcap">Mr. Beckford</span>
mentions a pack of this description who killed
<span class="pagenum">{473}</span>
<i>twenty-nine</i> foxes without intermission; that when
they were running, there was a <i>long string of them</i>,
and every <i>fault</i> was hit off by an old
<span class="smcap lowercase">SOUTHERN HOUND</span>.
When sufficient time has been employed
in forming a pack of hounds, they can never be
considered in a state of excellence or superiority,
unless they go as if they were in harness; that is,
when they are running <i>breast high</i>, they should run
nearly all <i>a breast</i>; or, in other words, when clear
of covert, and crossing a country, the body might
nearly be covered with a sheet.</p>

<p>Nothing is a greater disgrace to the
<span class="smcap lowercase">MASTER</span>, the
<span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTSMAN</span>, or the pack,
than to see a parcel of
straggling <i>tail</i> hounds, labouring <i>in vain</i>; except
a leading hound loaded with a <i>leaden necklace</i>, to
restrain his speed, and depress the instinctive impulse
of his nature to a level with those who are
not his equals. This is a truly unsportsman-like
stretch of authority, bordering upon cruelty; and
would be much more "honored in the breach than
the observance." Hounds of either description
had better be parted with, than to encounter constantly
a mortification so easily to be removed;
and both will be the less likely to happen, the more
moderate the number taken to the field. The
taking out too many hounds is a frequent error in
judgment, always productive of trouble, and
sometimes to a most vexatious diminution of
sport, to the incessant employment of the whipper-in,
<span class="pagenum">{474}</span>
whose horse is the greatest sufferer upon the
occasion.</p>

<p>Hounds differ much in their properties, according
to the crosses in blood, and this is plainly
perceptible to a nice observer, as well in their endeavours
to find, as in the pursuit of their game;
for those retaining most of the southern hound in
their blood, are always the most constitutionally
tardy in action. The north country beagle, (now
called harrier,) with a cross of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">DWARF FOX HOUND</span>,
has produced a direct contrast to the
former, and are generally in use in those open
countries where horses can lay by the side of them.
The delight of the old southern hound is to <i>dwell</i>
upon the <i>scent</i>; the extatic eagerness of the latter
is to <i>press it before him</i>. When the former come
to a fault, and can carry the scent no farther, they
stick their noses to the ground as close together as
a swarm of bees, making few or no efforts of
<i>their own</i>, unless <i>lifted along</i> by the helping hand
and encouraging voice of the <span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTSMAN</span>.
The exertions of the latter are instantaneous and indefatigable;
they make their cast in different directions,
without a moment's pause, and every individual
pants with emulation to become the happy
instrument of recovery: once <i>hit off</i>, the general
struggle for pre-eminence constitutes a scene by far
too luxurious for the inadequate representation of
literary description.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{475}</div>

<p>Opposite as these chases are, they are not without
their distinct and different votaries: the tempers
of some men, and the age or infirmities of
others, render their minds as gloomy as the atmosphere
of the <i>winter's day</i> in which they
<span class="smcap lowercase">HUNT</span>;
to these the solemn knell of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">SOUTHERN HOUND</span>
is so <i>musically mechanical</i>, that it seems to vibrate
in unison with the somniferous melancholy of their
own sensations. But with those in the health and
pride of manhood, who enjoy the obstacles, and
surmount the difficulties, of
<span class="smcap lowercase">CROSSING</span> a
<span class="smcap lowercase">COUNTRY</span>,
in direct contrast to the ruminative pleasure of
<i>whipping</i> a <i>thistle</i>, or riding a few rings round a
barn, fleet hounds will always have the preference.
Hounds of this description, it must be candidly
confessed, are, however, drawn too fine in their
formation, and so critically refined to speed, that
the game, whatever it may be, can stand but a
little time before them: unless, from stormy
weather, or some other accidental cause, much
cold hunting should intervene. And this, in the
present rage for improvement, is so much the case
with <span class="smcap lowercase">HARRIERS</span> in general, that,
in the early part of
the season, half the hares found are run up to in
the <i>first view</i>; and even after Christmas, when
they are supposed to get strong; average chases do
not exceed from twenty minutes to half an hour;
and by the unprecedented speed of hounds, as they
are now bred, the fox chase is contracted in proportion.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{476}</div>

<p>Although the breeding, entering, feeding, airing,
and general management of hounds, is an entire
system, dependent upon personal practice,
from a strict and attentive attachment to which
<i>alone</i>, excellence can be derived; yet, such rules
and salutary regulations as stand high in sporting
estimation, may be introduced for the information
of those, who, in the infancy of initiation, are
anxious to improve their judgment, by blending
the theory of the closet with the practice of the
field. The spring months are the best in which
puppies can be produced; they have then the
whole summer to expand and grow in. Some circumspection
is necessary in the business of propagation,
to prevent an unnecessary destruction; attention
should be paid to shape, size, colour, disposition,
and qualification, of both the dog and bitch
intended to breed from; if the perfection of sire
or dam are wished, or expected, to be retained,
and displayed, in the offspring. The sporting
world are enjoined by the best authority, "on no
account to breed from one that is not <i>stout</i>, that is
not <i>tender nosed</i>, or that is either a <i>babbler</i> or a
<i>skirter</i>: it is the judicious cross that makes the
pack complete. The faults and imperfections in
one breed, may be rectified in another; and if this
be properly attended to, no reason can be suggested,
why the breeding of hounds may not improve,
till improvement can go no further."</p>

<div class="pagenum">{477}</div>

<p>Amidst general remarks, it may be remembered,
that none but healthy and strong hounds should be
bred from: old dogs should never be put to old
bitches; and good whelps should never be put
to bad walks: stinted in their earliest growth, (by
a want of proper nutriment,) the frame becomes
impoverished, the loins weak, and they are the
less able to encounter that terrible foe, the <i>distemper</i>,
whenever it may make its attack. This generally
happens from the sixth to the ninth or tenth
month, and proves incredibly destructive, which
probably may be chiefly owing to the little that is
done upon those occasions, by the way of either
prevention or cure. Various are the opinions respecting
the number of hounds it may be necessary
to keep in kennel during the hunting season; and
these must be regulated by the kind of country
they have to hunt, as one may tire or lame hounds
more than another: slippery, marley clay will do
the one; the rolling flints of <span class="smcap">Surrey</span>,
<span class="smcap">Oxfordshire</span>,
or <span class="smcap">Hampshire</span>, never fail to do the other.
Those who are prudent, will never take more than
from twenty to five-and-twenty couple to the field;
to exceed which, would not only be rather <i>unfair</i>,
but probably do more <i>harm</i> than
<span class="smcap lowercase">GOOD</span>. The
number necessary to be taken, is not so material a
matter of consideration, as their conjunctive qualifications
when there; thirty-five couple of settled,
steady, seasoned hounds, will, therefore, admit of
hunting three (occasionally four) days a week.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{478}</div>

<p>It is a well-founded opinion, that every kennel
should have a proper annual supply of young
hounds; if this is neglected for <i>two</i> or <i>three</i> seasons,
the pack will soon be overloaded with old hounds,
and suddenly fall into decay. Industrious, hard-working
hounds, seldom continue in full <span class="smcap">vigour</span>
and speed longer than <i>five</i> or <i>six</i> seasons; though
there are not wanting instances of deserving favourites
having continued the <i>crack</i> hounds of the
pack for eight or nine years in succession. A little
of this difference may probably proceed from <i>two</i>
causes, a variation in constitution, and a contrast
in the discipline of the <span class="smcap lowercase">KENNEL</span>;
from which <span class="smcap">Mr. Beckford</span>
candidly confesses he never was long
absent, without perceiving a difference <i>in their
looks</i> at his return. It is also his opinion, that
from eight to twelve couple of young hounds, bred
annually, would sufficiently supply an establishment
not exceeding forty couple; but it is always
best to have a reserve of a few couple more than
wanted, in case of accidents; since, from the time
the draft is made, to the time of hunting, is a long
period, and their existence at that age and season
very precarious: besides, when they are safe from
the distemper, they are not always so from each
other; and a summer seldom passes without some
losses of that kind. At the same time he hints the
absurdity of <i>entering</i> more than are necessary to
keep up the pack, as a greater number would only
create useless trouble, and more vexation.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{479}</div>

<p>No one subject, perhaps, has so nearly exhausted
the fertility of human invention, as the infinity of
names bestowed upon <span class="smcap lowercase">HOUNDS</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">HORSES</span>; which
have been so numerous and diversified, that a single
name can hardly be adopted, which has not been
before brought into use. In proof of which, the
writer just mentioned has given a list of more than
<i>eight hundred</i> appellations, or terms by which
hounds may be known: but as the name of each
hound should as nearly as possible correspond with
the sport, (as well as the most apparent qualification
of the individual,) such only are introduced here
as are the most musical, and from which a variety
for even <span class="smcap lowercase">TWO</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">THREE PACKS</span> may be selected.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hounds</span> are constantly liable to those distressing
disorders the <span class="smcap lowercase">DISTEMPER</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">CANINE MADNESS</span>, as
well as to that vexatious and troublesome disease
called the <span class="smcap lowercase">MANGE</span>.
As well with hounds as with
horses, <i>prevention</i>, in all cases, is preferable to
<span class="smcap lowercase">CURE</span>: unfortunately,
there is as yet no mode discovered
by which either of the former can be prevented.
The <i>distemper</i>, if attended to upon its <i>first</i>
appearance, may with as much certainty be counteracted,
in the severity of its symptoms, by medical
interposition, as the variolus matter is divested
of its malignant miasma by the alleviating preparatives
previous to inoculation. The only specifics
by which a purpose so desirable can be effected,
are the preparations of <span class="smcap lowercase">MERCURY</span>
blended with small
proportions of <span class="smcap lowercase">EMETIC TARTAR</span>,
as the judicious
practitioner may find applicable to the predominant
appearances of the case. It has been observed, and
with great reason, that as the universality of the <i>distemper</i>
has evidently increased during the last twenty
or thirty years, so the more destructive calamity of
<span class="smcap lowercase">MADNESS</span> amongst the <i>species</i>
has evidently declined.</p>

<p>As it is certain the <i>distemper</i> may be arrested, in
the severity of its progress, by timely intervention,
so the first symptoms of its appearance cannot be
too perfectly explained. It is preceded by a husky
dryness in the throat; as if a small bone, or some
similar obstruction, was fixed there, from which
the animal, by an incessant kind of straining and
half cough, seems constantly endeavouring to relieve itself.
<span class="pagenum">{484}</span>
This is soon followed by a slimy discharge
from the nostrils; and an adhesive gummy
matter exudes from the eyes: food of every kind is
refused; the eyes become sunk and glassy: the carcase,
behind the ribs, is invariably contracted, and
a stricture is to be observed upon the abdominal
muscles, as if bound with a cord. As the disorder
becomes more inveterate in its progress, other
symptoms ensue; every day demonstrates additional
debility and emaciation; eternal strainings to vomit,
and those severe and violent, producing nothing
more than a mere viscid phlegm or slimy mucus
from the glands: a frequent tenesmus, or straining
to evacuate by stool, without effect, is also attendant:
to this succeeds a distressing weakness of
the loins, occasioning a twisting and distortion of
the hinder extremities, as if a disjunction of the
vertebræ had taken place. If the disorder is not
counteracted at or before its <span class="smcap lowercase">CRISIS</span>,
spasms and twitchings become perceptible about the head and
neck; the discharge from the nose and eyes assume
a <i>dry</i> and <i>barky</i> appearance, forming a kind of
matted eschar upon the surface; the eyes become
more and more sunk, till nearly closed: a ropy
slime oozes from each side the jaws, which seem
nearly fixed; a drooping dizziness, and frequent
disposition to turning round, is commonly seen
during this stage; and fits soon follow, which, more
or less, continue till, during some one of these paroxysms,
<span class="smcap lowercase">DEATH</span> closes the
<span class="smcap lowercase">SCENE</span>.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{485}</div>

<p>In the earlier stages of the distemper, the well-known
powder of <span class="smcap">Doctor James</span> has been brought
into use with success. It may, however, be necessary
to premise, that no good effect is to be expected
from small and ineffectual doses; they must
be large to be efficacious: no relief can be obtained,
but by taking off the general stricture, removing
the obstructions, promoting the various secretions,
and constituting revulsion. When it is so evidently
ascertained, that all dogs labouring under the distemper,
have both the stomach and intestinal canal
disordered, and in a state of extreme irritation, it
is natural to advert a little to the <i>filth</i>, <i>dirt</i>, <i>gravel</i>,
<i>sand</i>, <i>dry grass</i>, <i>straw</i>, and various other extraneous
particles, young <span class="smcap lowercase">DOGS</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">PUPPIES</span> ravenously
swallow with the chance food they happen to pick
up: and it is equally worthy attention, that the
prelude to visible amendment is generally the discharge
of an indurated <span class="smcap lowercase">MASS</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">PELLET</span> from the
<span class="smcap lowercase">ANUS</span>, which,
when broken to pieces is found to
consist of the before-mentioned articles; and, beyond
a doubt, by retarding some secretions, and
obstructing others, contributes in no small degree to
increase the inveteracy of disease. For explanatory
remarks upon <span class="smcap lowercase">CANINE MADNESS</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">HYDROPHOBIA</span>,
see <span class="smcap">Dogs</span>.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap lowercase">MANGE</span>, when it has once found its way
into a kennel, is a most troublesome, loathsome,
and infectious disorder: if it has not been introduced
<span class="pagenum">{486}</span>
by the latter, it must have originated in an
<i>acrimonious</i> and vitiated state of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">BLOOD</span>, arising
from too long a perseverance in some impoverished
or <i>putrified</i> kind of food; a want of proper
<span class="smcap lowercase">AIR</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">EXERCISE</span>;
or a culpable deficiency in <i>cleanliness</i>;
without all which, health and strength need not
long be expected. The mange is a disorder too
well known not only in <span class="smcap lowercase">HOUNDS</span>,
but every other
<i>kind</i> of <span class="smcap lowercase">DOG</span>,
to require description; and for the
cure of which, <span class="smcap lowercase">AUTHORS</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">COMPILERS</span>, and
<span class="smcap lowercase">EDITORS</span>,
of every class, have furnished means in abundance,
sulphur vivum, oil of turpentine, gunpowder, ginger,
train oil, foot, and a tedious
<span class="smcap lowercase">COMBINATION</span> of
<span class="smcap lowercase">COMBUSTIBLES</span>,
(with various alternatives, in cases
of failure,) are recommended to extirpate what
may be completely eradicated without half the nastiness
or trouble. All that <i>externals</i> can do, may
be expected from three plentiful bastings of a very
cheap and easily-procured composition, consisting
of sulphur vivum, four ounces; white hellebore
powder, two ounces; black pepper, very finely
powdered, one ounce; sal armoniac, (finely powdered
likewise,) half an ounce; oil of tartar, one
ounce; and common olive oil, one pint; with
which the diseased subject should have every affected
part <i>fully</i> and <i>forcibly</i> impregnated with the
hand at three different times, three days apart
during which process, at the same equal distances
of time, three <span class="smcap lowercase">MERCURIAL PURGING BALLS</span>
of a proper strength (proportioned to the <i>age</i>, <i>size</i>, and
<span class="pagenum">{487}</span>
<i>strength</i>, of the dog) should be administered, if a
sure and speedy cure is to be expected.</p>

<p>The disorder called the <span class="smcap lowercase">RED MANGE</span>
does not appear to be nearly allied to what is so well known by
the common appellation of <span class="smcap lowercase">MANGE</span>,
but to be a
species of disease within itself, seated in the skin,
and not always infectious amongst dogs laying together,
but almost invariably communicated by a
<span class="smcap lowercase">BITCH</span> to her
<span class="smcap lowercase">LITTER</span> of
<span class="smcap lowercase">WHELPS</span>, particularly if she
had it upon her during the time she was in pup.
This disorder is most malignant in its effect; the
incessant and severe itching, which, from all observation,
seems accompanied by a <i>burning heat</i>, and
this too increased by the perpetual biting and
scratching of the tortured animal, gives such parts
of the frame as are severely affected, the appearance
of having been <i>scalded</i> by some boiling liquor,
with a consequent loss of hair. It is this distinct
kind of <span class="smcap lowercase">MANGE</span>
that so constantly baffles <span class="smcap lowercase">DOG-DOCTORS</span>
and <i>dog-mongers</i> of every description, and reduces
them to their <i>ne plus ultra</i>, where the fertility
of invention can go no further. It is, perhaps,
the most deceptive disorder to which any part of the
animal world can become unluckily subject; for
when it has (seemingly and repeatedly) submitted
to, and been subdued by, some of the combination
of combustibles before described, it has as suddenly,
as repeatedly, and as unexpectedly, made its reappearance
with all its former virulence. Great
<span class="pagenum">{488}</span>
care, nice attention, and long experience, can discover
but one infallible mode of perfect eradication.
Let half an ounce of <span class="smcap lowercase">CORROSIVE SUBLIMATE</span>
be reduced in a glass mortar to an impalpable powder;
to this, by a very small quantity at a time, add two
ounces (half a gill) of spirits of wine; and, lastly,
one pint of rain or river water, and, with a sponge
dipt in the solution, let every part palpably affected
be well washed, every third day, till thrice performed;
then leave three clear days, and repeat
the former ceremony of thrice as before; letting
three <span class="smcap lowercase">MERCURIAL PURGING BALLS</span>
be given at the
equal distances stated in the common mange, and
no doubt of cure need be entertained, if the mode
prescribed is properly and judiciously attended to.</p>

<p>However opinions may vary upon the manner of
<span class="smcap lowercase">FEEDING</span> hounds,
as well in respect to time, as the
occasional changes in, and <i>property</i> of, the
<span class="smcap lowercase">FOOD</span>
best adapted to the purpose of nutritious
<span class="smcap lowercase">SUPPORT</span>,
no opposition whatever can arise to the general inculcation
of <span class="smcap lowercase">CLEANLINESS</span>,
as indispensibly conducive
to the preservation of <span class="smcap lowercase">HEALTH</span>,
and consequent
exclusion of <span class="smcap lowercase">DISEASE</span>.
In the acceptation of the
word <i>cleanliness</i>, may be included the true intent
and meaning of both internal and external circumspection
and attention, as well in <span class="smcap lowercase">PHYSIC</span>, and in
<span class="smcap lowercase">FOOD</span>,
as in the neat and judicious arrangement of
the <span class="smcap lowercase">KENNEL</span>;
where the conjunctive force of which
is wanting, what a train of <i>disease</i>, <i>misery</i>, and
<span class="pagenum">{489}</span>
wretchedness, frequently ensues! To avoid all
which, at the times and seasons found most proper
for their introduction,
<span class="smcap lowercase">ANTIMONIAL ALTERATIVES</span>,
and <span class="smcap lowercase">MERCURIAL PURGATIVES</span>,
should be brought
into use. Upon this practice <span class="smcap">Mr. Beckford</span> has
given his opinion in the following words.</p>

<p>"I am not fond of <i>bleeding</i> hounds, unless they
want it; though it has long been a custom to <i>physic</i>
them twice a year; after they leave off hunting,
and before they begin. It is given in hot weather,
and at an idle time. It cools their bodies, and,
without doubt, is of service to them. If a hound
be in want of physic, I prefer giving it in balls.
<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_3" id="Ref_3" href="#Foot_3">[3]</a></span>
It is more easy to give in this manner the quantity
he may want, and you are more certain that he
takes it. In many kennels, they also bleed them
twice a year, and some people think that it prevents
madness. The anointing of hounds, or <i>dressing</i>
them, as huntsmen call it, makes them fine in their
coats: it may be done twice a year, or oftener, if
found necessary."</p>

<p>The necessity of introducing something medicinal
for the preservation of health, and prevention of
disease, is thus admitted upon the best of all foundations,
<span class="pagenum">{490}</span>
practical experience; but as medical precision
cannot be expected from those who have not
made the profession their study, so <span class="smcap">Mr. Beckford</span>
seems to have applied "<i>physic</i>" in a general sense
to every kind of <span class="smcap lowercase">MEDICINE</span>,
as well to <span class="smcap lowercase">ALTERATIVES</span>
as to <span class="smcap lowercase">PURGATIVES</span>;
though the term, when used
technically, is conceived to imply the latter only.
According to this construction, it is to be presumed,
Mr. Beckford administered the balls as "physic,"
when, in fact, they can only be termed antimonial
alteratives, calculated to obtund acrimony, and
alter the property of the blood. Mercurial purgatives
perfectly cleanse the intestinal canal, and correct
morbidity at the same time. External applications,
called "<i>dressings</i>," are more particularly
directed to bodily eruptions, and cutaneous diseases
of the skin: in all these, <span class="smcap lowercase">SULPHUR</span>
is a principal ingredient, and looked upon as a specific: in fact,
its efficacy is too well known to admit of a doubt
upon the occasion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hounds</span>, as well as
<span class="smcap lowercase">HORSES</span>, are rendered subservient
instruments to the support of Government,
and exigencies of the State. Persons keeping them
pay a tax of <span class="smcap lowercase">THIRTY POUNDS</span> per annum.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_3" id="Foot_3" href="#Ref_3">[3]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
One pound of antimony, four ounces of sulphur, and syrup of
buckthorn a sufficient quantity to give it a proper consistence. Each
ball to weigh about seven drachms.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>HOUZING</h3><p>.—The houzing of a horse is a part
of military paraphernalia appertaining to officers of
cavalry in general, and the privates of the King's
horse guards in particular; consisting of scarlet
<span class="pagenum">{491}</span>
trappings ornamented with gold lace, fringe, and
some part of the insignia of the crown. They are
fastened to the hinder part of the saddle, and suspended
from the loins, so as to cover the flanks,
and a part of the hind-quarters on each side.
<span class="smcap">General</span>
and <span class="smcap lowercase">FIELD OFFICERS</span> have their houzings
principally manufactured of lions, tigers, or leopard's
skins, giving additional magnificence to the
stately grandeur of the <span class="smcap lowercase">MILITARY CHARGER</span>.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>HUMOURS</h3><p>.—All chronic disorders in the
horse, arising from an impure state of the blood,
are with the inferior classes in general denominated
"<span class="smcap lowercase">HUMOURS</span>;"
as a concise mode of avoiding scientific
investigation, or medical ambiguity, and bringing
the case immediately home, as they think, to
<i>every</i> comprehension. With people of the description
alluded to (whether <span class="smcap lowercase">SMITHS</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">FARRIERS</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">COACHMEN</span>,
or <span class="smcap lowercase">GROOMS</span>)
the word <i>humours</i> is conceived so
wonderfully comprehensive, that it is <i>by them</i> supposed
to convey an infinite idea of <i>every thing</i>, at
the very moment it is known, by their superiors and
employers, to imply no definite or certain meaning
at all. If a horse has swelled legs, they are the
effect of "<i>humours</i>." If an inflammation of and
defluxion from the eyes, they are equally produced
by "<i>humours</i>." Should cracked heels appear (the
evident effect of idleness, and want of attention)
they too are brought on by "<i>humours</i>." Even
thrushes, occasioned in general by equal neglect and
<span class="pagenum">{492}</span>
want of cleanliness, are also frequently attributed
to "<i>humours</i>;" and to sum up the intrinsic value
of this professional <span class="smcap lowercase">GEM</span>,
even lameness, in a variety
of cases, whether behind or before, above or below,
is most <i>sapiently</i>, if not
<span class="smcap lowercase">SCIENTIFICALLY</span>, attributed
to that <i>ne plus ultra</i> of definition, denominated
<i>humours</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>Thus far upon what <span class="smcap lowercase">HUMOURS</span> are
<i>supposed</i> to be;
now to what they are. It may readily be conceived
by those not professionally informed on the subject,
that the <span class="smcap lowercase">BLOOD</span>
(which is the very mainspring of
existence) must have preserved such kind of equality,
consistency, or uniformity, in its component
parts, as to constitute a precise standard, necessary
to the enjoyment and preservation of
<span class="smcap lowercase">HEALTH</span>.
This incontrovertible position being admitted beyond
all possible ground of controversy, what does
it evidently demonstrate? Why, that as much as
the <span class="smcap lowercase">BLOOD</span> is enriched
<i>above</i>, or impoverished <i>below</i>,
that <span class="smcap lowercase">STANDARD</span>,
in its <i>property</i>, so in proportion
must it approach the kind of disease appertaining to
the one extreme or the other. To those whose intellectual
rays are open to conviction, not a single
line more would be required in explanation; but
that the most <i>incredulous</i>, the most <i>obstinate</i>, and
the most <i>illiterate</i>, may have equal opportunity
of information, let the two different states of the
blood, (as just explained,) with their effects, be
adverted to. When it has, by a superabundance
<span class="pagenum">{493}</span>
of food and ease, a neglect of exercise, and a want
of the necessary evacuations, acquired a degree of
consistence (or thickness) above the criterion already
described, it then becomes too <i>heavy</i> and
<i>sluggish</i> for its purpose of regular
<span class="smcap lowercase">CIRCULATION</span>,
and is proportionally inadequate to the task of propelling
the perspirative matter to the surface, which
being thus compulsively returned upon the blood,
adds to its siziness, and promotes its viscidity,
jointly tending to such partial stagnation, as soon
displays itself in some one of the many disorders to
which horses are incident, in the hands of those
where prevention is not attended to.</p>

<p>Having taken a survey of the state of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">BLOOD</span>,
by which swelled legs, grease, foulness,
inflammatory tumours, formations of matter in various
parts, and one species of farcy, may be produced,
it will be necessary to take a short view of
it in its contrasted state, when, by a continued series
of <i>hard</i> work, with <i>bad</i> keep, a constant supply
of unhealthy provender, in <i>musty</i> oats, <i>mouldy</i>
hay, or any other article distending the body, without
adequate nutriment to the frame, as well as the
want of a proper supply, in proportion to the necessary
<span class="smcap lowercase">SECRETIONS</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">EVACUATIONS</span>, will either,
or all, tend to <i>diminish</i> the
<span class="smcap lowercase">CRASSAMENTUM</span>, or adhesive
property of the blood, and in a greater or
less degree (according to the cause) reduce it to a
serous or weak and watery state, below the standard
<span class="pagenum">{494}</span>
of mediocrity so clearly explained; when acquiring
acrimony in proportion as it has been reduced, the
effect seldom rests upon emaciation only, but soon
displays itself in some cutaneous eruption, so constantly
dependent upon, and appertaining to, an
impoverished state of the blood.</p>

<p>This distinction has been introduced, not more to
throw some satisfactory light upon the ambiguity
of the expression, which it seems so few understand,
than to prove the necessity for paying such attention
to the general state of a
<span class="smcap lowercase">HORSE'S HEALTH</span> and
appearance, as may at least be the means of preventing
disease, anxiety, trouble, expence, and probably
the eventual loss of a useful, or even a valuable,
animal, which too often happens for want of a little
humane circumspection; when it is then experimentally
found <span class="smcap lowercase">REPENTANCE</span> comes too late. As
the <i>fertile</i> idea of
<span class="smcap lowercase">HUMOURS</span> frequently originates in
error, so the error is continued in the medical mode
of counteraction; for let the derangement in the
animal economy have happened from whichever of
the causes described, the system adopted is much
the same in all cases, and with all classes, rendering
sometimes the remedy worse than the disease.
Those, however, who wish to blend instruction
with entertainment, deriving advantage from both,
will do well to recollect, that whatever
<span class="smcap lowercase">DISORDERS</span>
(alias <i>humours</i>) originate in plethora, fulness of the
frame, and viscidity of the blood, must be subdued
<span class="pagenum">{495}</span>
by repeated <span class="smcap lowercase">BLEEDINGS</span>,
moderate <span class="smcap lowercase">PURGING</span>, regular
exercise, a great deal of stable discipline, (wisping,
leg-rubbing, &amp;c.) and, if necessary, a concluding
course of <span class="smcap lowercase">MILD DIURETICS</span>.
Disorders arising from
a weak and impoverished state of the blood last described,
must be counteracted by an extra addition
of nutritive aliment, as mashes of ground malt and
bran nightly, as well as the usual supplies of corn
by day: an invigorating cordial ball daily should
assist the intent; and a course of<span class="smcap lowercase">ANTIMONIAL ALTERATIVES</span>
be lastly introduced, to give a new complexion
to the property of the blood.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>HUMBLES</h3><p>.—The articles so called are some of
the internal <i>trimmings</i> obtained in breaking up a
<span class="smcap lowercase">DEER</span>,
which are always a perquisite of the keeper.</p>

</div>

<div class="combine">

<h3>HUNTER</h3><p>.—A hunter, in its strictest implied
signification with the <span class="smcap lowercase">SPORTING WORLD</span>,
is a horse
or mare of superior description and qualifications,
appropriated to no other purpose whatever than the
enjoyment of the chase. As it is the highest ambition
of every <span class="smcap lowercase">SPORTSMAN</span>
to be in possession of a
<span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTER</span>, numbers are so called,
who are by no
means entitled to that distinction. Various opinions
are entertained respecting the more minute properties
of a horse destined to the particular purposes of
the field, and this diversity can only be justified by
an allusion to the kind of hounds with whom he is
intended to hunt. Horses of an inferior description,
<span class="pagenum">{496}</span>
cross bred, and without a point of perfection, or
the property of speed, may be called
<span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTERS</span> with
<i>harriers</i>; but prove mere roadsters, when brought
into the field with either <span class="smcap lowercase">STAG</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">FOX</span>. One third
of a century since, moderate horses were called
hunters; and those about <span class="smcap lowercase">HALF BRED</span>
went tolerably well up to <i>most</i> hounds; but during the last twenty
years, so great has been the rage for improving
their speed, that in the present day, any horse may
<i>follow</i> the hounds; but
<span class="smcap lowercase">BLOOD HORSES</span> only can go
by the side of them.</p>

</div>

<p>The horses now denominated <span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTERS</span>,
are mostly three parts and full bred; for the great number
of blood horses not turning out <span class="smcap lowercase">WINNERS</span>,
as well as those not trained for the turf, come of
course to the hunting stables, and keep up a constant
supply. Under the head <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSE</span>,
three distinct kinds are mentioned generally, and the purposes to
which they are assigned; but no particular description
is made of a <span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTER</span>,
whose qualifications are
properly reserved for this place. A hunter for
constant use with fleet hounds, should be well bred
on both sides; not less in age than five years old
off; from fifteen hands and an inch, to fifteen
three and sixteen hands, but not to exceed it: large
and heavy horses, in <i>deep</i> or <i>hilly</i> countries, frequently
tire themselves. To be handsome, he
should be strong in the frame and formation, short
in the joints, firm in his fetlocks, quick in the eye,
<span class="pagenum">{497}</span>
and agile in action. He should have a light airy
head, wide nostrils, prominent lively eye, slight
curve in the crest, long in the neck, wide in the
breast, deep in the chest, high in the withers,
straight in the spine, short in the back, round in
the barrel, full in the flank, (the last rib coming
well up to the point of the hip-bone,) his loins
wide, and rather circular than flat; the summit of
the hind-quarters, between the fillets and the tail,
should nearly form one section of an oval; the tail
should be high, and well set on, in nearly a direct
line from the back, and not in a drooping degree
below the rump: there should be perceptible
strength, uniformity and substance in the thighs,
and a prominent muscular swell in the exterior of
the gaskins; a great length from the hip-bone to
the hock, short from thence to the fetlock, which
should be nearly round, and well united; the pasterns
rather short than long; fore-legs straight,
and upright; hoofs, black, and of a strong firm texture;
great courage, good temper, and pliability
of disposition.</p>

<p>These are the rules by which thousands will admit
a <span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTER</span> should be chosen;
and they will also
as readily admit, the very great difficulty with
which horses of such description are to be obtained.
However, as such an accumulation of perfections
is so rarely to be found in the same object, the most
emulous and judicious will be the more anxious to
<span class="pagenum">{498}</span>
come as near to such criterion as circumstances will
permit; but as it is not to be expected the young,
any more than the inexperienced, can retain the
minutiæ of a description to which they have been
so little accustomed, as well as recollecting the
force <span class="smcap lowercase">EXAMPLE</span>
is said to have beyond <i>precept</i>, the
<span class="smcap lowercase">PORTRAIT</span> of a
<span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTER</span> is introduced, who, for all
the qualifications already described, was repeatedly
in the field (with his <span class="smcap">Majesty's stag hounds</span>)
honoured with the royal approbation. He was got
by <i>Eclipse</i>, dam by <i>Blank</i>, and possessed every requisite
in the field to render himself an object of
universal attraction: after <span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTING</span>
two seasons, and <span class="smcap lowercase">COVERING</span> one,
he was purchased, and taken to
America as <span class="smcap lowercase">A STALLION</span>.</p>

<p>Having explicitly laid down the rules by which
a horse should be selected for the purpose particularly
expressed, some farther hints become necessary
for his general management, if a wish is entertained
to preserve him in a state of purity; for
it is well known, there cannot be a greater stigma
annexed to the character of a professed sportsman,
than his having a <span class="smcap lowercase">GOOD</span> horse in
<i>bad</i> condition. The
next great qualification to
<span class="smcap lowercase">SPEED</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">TEMPER</span> in a
hunter, is the property of leaping, both <i>standing</i>
and <i>flying</i>; without those (in an enclosed country)
his leading perfections are very much reduced in
the estimation of the field: on the contrary, if he
is in the full and unrestrained possession of these additional,
<span class="pagenum">{499}</span>
and, indeed, indispensible requisites to
complete and confirm his character, a purchaser
may always be commanded at any price. One
great error is generally prevalent in teaching horses
to <span class="smcap lowercase">LEAP</span>, by the young,
petulant, and hasty, when
<i>first</i> they are brought to the
<span class="smcap lowercase">BAR</span>, particularly in
and round the Metropolis, where an assistant is frequently
seen with a <i>whip</i> to expedite what cannot
be proceeded upon with too much kindness and
circumspection. Young horses driven to a bar with
a whip, and once <i>alarmed</i>, are sometimes prevented
from becoming good standing leapers during their
existence. Instances are very rare of well-bred
horses being bad <span class="smcap lowercase">FLYING LEAPERS</span>,
particularly with
hounds; few, <i>if any</i>, have ever been seen willing
to stay <i>behind</i> when the pack were before them;
they of course require no other instructions, than
what the experience of the field affords them. When
horses are intended for the field, they should be
brought and accustomed to the bar, previous to
their being put upon their mettle, and flurried with
hounds; when there, the bar should never be less
than three feet from the ground; if lower, it only
induces the horse to attempt it with one foot, as if
to walk or scramble over it; and this is a bad habit
to acquire: he should never be permitted to make
an effort, till taught to rest entirely upon his
haunches, and to raise slowly and gradually both
his feet before at the same moment.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{500}</div>

<p>Nothing can be more contemptibly ridiculous,
than the absurd practice of clothing the
<span class="smcap lowercase">BAR</span> with
<i>bushes of furze</i>; and this is generally introduced,
under the plausible pretence of making the horse
<i>clear his leap</i>; although it is a fact, that almost
every horse is terrified in approaching it; and when
compelled to take it, or is rather <i>driven over</i>, it is
in a <span class="smcap lowercase">JUMP</span> of
<i>fear</i> and <i>agitation</i>; not in a cool,
temperate, and steady leap of safety, fit to qualify
a <span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTER</span> for the
<span class="smcap lowercase">FIELD</span>. A horse can only be
made a good standing leaper, by affording him ample
time to measure his leap before he attempts it;
that is, to observe its height, and take the space
necessary for the bend of his knees, the contraction
of his legs, and his own altitude to cover the leap
with certainty; and this a well-taught horse, of tolerable
temper, will generally do, if permitted to
adopt his own plan, and use his own exertions:
but if unnaturally hurried by the petulance, impatience,
or inhumanity, of those about him,
<i>failure</i>, <i>injury</i>, and <i>disgrace</i>, frequently ensue.
The proper covering for a leaping-bar should
either be fern, or clean wheat straw, well secured
by a strong packthread, bound transversely and
longitudinally in a kind of net-work, (bracing
equally every way,) which is not only exceedingly
durable, but being composed of articles to which
the horse is so accustomed, he naturally approaches
it, if gently used, and patiently encouraged, without
the least fear or agitation.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{501}</div>

<p>The proper stable discipline, and general management,
of hunters, are so perfectly understood
in the present state of equestrian emulation, and
universal improvement, that a few experimental
maxims only are required, as mementos to shield
the young, inconsiderate, and unwary, from unthinkingly
encountering various foundations of
vexation, trouble, expence, and disappointment.
Those of immense fortunes, and adequate establishments,
are not so liable to this aggregate of ills, as
those whose more humble and confined possessions
restrain them within a much smaller sphere of gratification.
To the latter, therefore, it is, such
hints of utility are more particularly addressed and
submitted, who not having the good fortune to be
surrounded with a profusion of subordinates, by
whom such offices are generally executed, feel the
necessity, and enjoy the happy opportunity, of
sometimes personally superintending their own concerns.
The great exertions in respect to speed, labour,
and durability, of which the well-bred hunter
is so evidently capable, are almost beyond belief;
and eminently entitle him to every adequate tenderness,
care, and attention, that can be possibly bestowed
in return. When it is within the compass
of the reflecting mind, that an animal of this description
is frequently most laboriously engaged for the
whole of a dreary winter's day, encountering and
surmounting difficulties in succession almost beyond
description, (till in many instances nature is nearly
<span class="pagenum">{502}</span>
exhausted,) no doubt can arise, but the frame must
sometimes stand in need of extra assistance upon
such occasions.</p>

<p>Of this greater proof need not be adduced, than
the deaths of horses which have recently happened,
(particularly with the King's stag hounds,) some in
the field, and many within a few days after different
chases of singular severity; one instance of which
is so truly remarkable, that it lays claim to record
in the annals of sporting, to prevent its being buried
in oblivion. The <span class="smcap lowercase">DEER</span> was turned out at
<span class="smcap">Ascot Heath</span>, and,
after making <span class="smcap">Bagshot Park</span>, crossed
the whole of the heath country, to Sandhurst,
through Finchamstead Woods, Barkham, Arborfield,
Swallowfield, and the intervening country,
to Tilehurst, below Reading in Berkshire, where
he was taken unhurt after a chase of
<span class="smcap lowercase">FOUR HOURS</span>
and <span class="smcap lowercase">TWENTY MINUTES</span>;
horsemen being <i>thrown out</i>
in every part of the country through which they
passed: one horse dropt <i>dead</i> in the
<span class="smcap lowercase">FIELD</span>; another,
after the chase, before he could reach a stable;
and <i>seven</i> more within the <span class="smcap lowercase">WEEK</span>:
of such speed, and almost unprecedented severity, was this run,
that <i>tired</i> horses in great danger were unavoidably
left at the different inns in the neighbourhood. A
tolerable idea of the powers of an English hunter
may, from this description, be formed by those
who are not sportsmen, and have consequently a
very imperfect conception of the task he has to perform;
<span class="pagenum">{503}</span>
of which incredulity <span class="smcap">Mons. Sainbel</span>, professor
of the <span class="smcap">Veterinary College</span>, gave sufficient
proof, treating the subject with the utmost indifference,
very little short of contempt; declaring,
"it was all <i>chimerical</i>, and that no horse could be
found to continue a chase of that kind <i>four hours</i> in
succession."</p>

<p>That such exertions may be continued till nature
itself is totally exhausted, must be admitted beyond
a doubt; but that they in general happen to horses
by much <i>too slow</i> for the <span class="smcap lowercase">CHASE</span>,
and to those in
<i>improper condition</i>, is as clearly ascertained. The
result of which facts clearly demonstrate the truth of
observations previously made, and forcibly inculcate
the indispensible necessity of selecting horses
properly formed for the purpose; and as forcibly
urge the propriety (indeed the safety) of getting
them into condition for the field. When taken up
from his summer's run at grass (which every perfect
hunter is entitled to) he should go through his regular
course of physic; the strength and number of
doses to be regulated by the accumulated flesh, and
general appearance of the horse: if in a fair, good,
clean state, not loaded in substance, and perfectly
clean in the skin, more than <span class="smcap lowercase">TWO</span>
doses may be superfluous;
if labouring under a weight of flesh,
flabby, and fluctuating under pressure, less than
<span class="smcap lowercase">THREE</span> will prove insufficient;
which should be preceded
by <span class="smcap lowercase">BLEEDING</span> in <i>either</i>,
according to the state
<span class="pagenum">{504}</span>
of the horse. During the operation of physic, the
subject should undergo moderate exercise, and
great friction in the stable; both which tend to remove
and circulate the stagnant fluids, that they
may be carried off by the evacuations. Great, regular
and patient leg-rubbing is not only absolutely
necessary at all times, but more particularly during
physic; it braces the solids, and preserves them in
a proper state of elasticity; for want of which, they
frequently acquire a degree of flaccidity; the legs
swell, and, if brought into work <i>too soon</i>, continue
in that state, <i>more</i> or <i>less</i>, during the season.</p>

<p>After the chase (during the dressing in the stable)
observation should be made whether injury of any
kind has been sustained during the day; either by
the heat and friction or pressure of the saddle, the
loss of a shoe, stubs, treads, over-reaches, bruises,
or lameness of any kind; for any of these once
discovered, the necessary remedy should be immediately
applied; as it not unfrequently happens,
that what in the first instance would only prove a
slight or trivial grievance, continues to increase in
proportion to the delay in discovery. Horses evidently
distrest and fatigued with the labour of the
day, displaying lassitude, bodily debility, and loss
of appetite, should be nicely attended to; a cordial
ball becomes more applicable and useful at this
time than any other; frequent supplies of water,
with the chill off, in moderate quantities, should
<span class="pagenum">{505}</span>
never be neglected; every horse is invariably thirsty
after a <i>hard day</i>; and many will take repeated supplies
of water, and plenty of hay, when they will
eat no corn; in which case, a good warm mash, of
<span class="smcap lowercase">GROUND MALT</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">BRAN</span>, is an excellent invigorating
substitute, and in many of the best managed
establishments is <i>never</i> omitted (particularly
with tender, delicate, or violent tempered horses)
after a <i>long</i> or <i>rainy</i> day, as a preventive to
<span class="smcap lowercase">COLD</span>,
as well as to <span class="smcap lowercase">DISEASE</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunters</span>, after long and severe chases, should
not be brought <i>too soon</i> into similar exertions;
numbers are crippled, broke down, and irrecoverably
ruined, for want of a little precautionary
patience: brought into the field too early, with a
stiff rigidity in the limbs, and without the wonted
pliability in the joints, the spirits, as well as the
frame, become affected by a consciousness of the
deficiency; and the <span class="smcap lowercase">RIDER</span>,
upon making the discovery,
moves in little less <i>misery</i> than the
<span class="smcap lowercase">HORSE</span>,
who, feeling his temporary imperfection, seems in
fear of falling at every stroke. A horse is best recovered
from the visible effect of over fatigue, by a
great deal of patient walking, exercise upon the
turf, and equally patient friction in the stable: no
horse perceptibly affected in <span class="smcap lowercase">FRAME</span>
or <span class="smcap lowercase">SPIRITS</span>, by
long days or severe chases, should be brought into
exercise <span class="smcap lowercase">GALLOPS</span>,
till every degree of <i>stiffness</i> is
previously worn away, and obliterated in gentle
<span class="pagenum">{506}</span>
motion, of which they are the first to make discovery,
by a renovation of strength and action. It is
in many hunting stables an invariable practice,
upon the appearance of <span class="smcap lowercase">LAMENESS</span>,
to bleed and follow up that with a dose of physic, exclusive of
whatever local applications it may be thought necessary
to make to the part affected; and this, it
must be acknowledged, is very frequently attended
with the most salutary effects: naturally, however,
leading the mind of scientific investigation to believe,
much of the advantage may be derived from
the rest obtained during the course, as from the
operation of the medicine.</p>

<div class="combine">

<h3>HUNTING</h3><p>,—in its general sense, implies the
pleasure of the <span class="smcap lowercase">SPORT</span> at
<span class="smcap lowercase">LARGE</span>, without specifying
any <i>particular kind</i> of <span class="smcap lowercase">CHASE</span>;
of which there are
three, and equally well known under the different
distinctions of <span class="smcap lowercase">STAG-HUNTING</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">FOX-HUNTING</span>, and
<span class="smcap lowercase">HARE-HUNTING</span>. A minor kind of sport,
called <span class="smcap lowercase">OTTER HUNTING</span>,
might formerly have been said to
constitute a <i>fourth</i>; but it is at present so little
known, (and much less practised,) that, like
<span class="smcap lowercase">HAWKING</span>,
it seems nearly buried in oblivion, and promises
very little prospect of sporting resurrection.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunting</span> is the pursuit of any species of
<span class="smcap lowercase">GAME</span>
(or vermin) with a collected body of
<span class="smcap lowercase">HOUNDS</span>,
sportingly termed a <span class="smcap lowercase">PACK</span>;
who, bred for, and broke
to, the chase, <span class="smcap lowercase">FIND</span> and
<span class="smcap lowercase">HUNT</span> the particular sort to
<span class="pagenum">{507}</span>
which they are appropriated by <i>scent</i>, <i>drag</i>, or <i>trail</i>,
till it escapes by the <span class="smcap lowercase">ARTS</span>,
<span class="smcap lowercase">WILES</span>, and
<span class="smcap lowercase">SAGACITY</span>,
with which it is gifted by <span class="smcap lowercase">NATURE</span>;
or, being exhausted,
falls <i>a victim</i> to the persevering patience,
indefatigable exertions, and instinctive impulse, of
the <span class="smcap lowercase">HOUNDS</span>. This sport,
in its different degrees,
is of very great antiquity, and has been enjoyed,
through successive centuries, with gradational improvements;
but at no former period has it ever
approached its present zenith of unparalleled perfection.
Some few reigns past, the enjoyment was
considered so truly extatic, that it was engrossed
entirely by the <span class="smcap lowercase">NOBLES</span>
and superior orders, to the
entire exclusion of the people at large, who were
then so much in a state of vassalage, as to be held
unworthy the participation of so rich a gratification,
under the most rigid proscription that legislative and
feudal <span class="smcap lowercase">LAWS</span> could frame,
or unqualified <span class="smcap lowercase">TYRANNY</span>
adopt. Not so in the happy melioration of the
present age, when every blessing, every privilege,
and every comfort of life, is equally enjoyed from
the <span class="smcap lowercase">HIGHEST</span> to the <i>lowest</i>,
according to the possessions
of every individual; under such necessary and
indispensible restrictions, as it may have been
found, by the Legislature, prudent to adopt, for
the preservation of <span class="smcap lowercase">ORDER</span>,
and promotion of
<span class="smcap lowercase">PUBLIC GOOD</span>.</p>

<p>Nothing can more clearly demonstrate the
attracting power, and exhilarating effects, of the
<span class="pagenum">{508}</span>
<span class="smcap lowercase">CHASE</span>, than the enthusiastic rapture
with which it is enjoyed, and the constantly increasing number
of its implicit devotees. Cynical opponents will
always continue to be generated, inveterately averse
to every pleasure, however sublime or select, that
is not immediately congenial to their own sensations;
and will with avidity declare perpetual war
against any gratification, or enjoyment, in which
they are not eventually interested, or personally
concerned. The bewildered <span class="smcap lowercase">POLITICIAN</span>,
who erroneously
suspends the <i>balance</i> of <i>power</i> in his own
disordered imagination; the <span class="smcap lowercase">PEDANTIC</span>
book-worm,
who derives <i>self-consequence</i> from his closet; the
<span class="smcap lowercase">MISER</span>,
who wraps himself up in the <i>solitary</i> consolation
of his <i>canvas comforts</i>; and those
<span class="smcap lowercase">PRIGS</span> of
<i>puppyism</i> (by <span class="smcap">Shakespeare</span> better denominated
"<i>poppinjays</i>") who exist only in their own personal
ambition, and the reflection from the silvered glass,
naturally decry pleasures, in which, from the innate
sterility, and instinctive apathy, of their own
souls, they feel no disposition to engage. <span class="smcap">Lovers</span>
of the <span class="smcap lowercase">CHASE</span>,
who, for time immemorial, have
been better known and distinguished by the appellation
of <span class="smcap lowercase">SPORTSMEN</span>,
are almost proverbial for
their mutual offices of civility and friendship; no
class of men enter more into the openness and
glowing warmth of unsuspecting society, the genial
inspiration of <span class="smcap lowercase">PHILANTHROPY</span>,
and the infinite inexpressible
extent of unsullied <span class="smcap lowercase">HOSPITALITY</span>.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{509}</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunting</span>, in respect to the enjoyment, as well
as the description of each <i>particular</i> kind of
<span class="smcap lowercase">CHASE</span>,
will be found under their distinct heads of
"<span class="smcap">Hare-Hunting</span>,"
"<span class="smcap">Fox-Hunting</span>," and
"<span class="smcap">Stag-Hunting</span>;"
leaving nothing for introduction here,
but such general remarks, and salutary inculcations,
as appertain solely to the systematic concerns
of the field. The prudent sportsman is invariably
the guardian of his own safety; for, however he
may rely upon the attachment and punctuality of
an old or faithful servant, he never declines the
service of his own faculties, so long as he can derive
advantage from their evident utility. He
therefore never mounts his horse, however great his
haste, however late his hour, without taking a slight
(but sufficient) survey of his apparatus: he feels it
a duty to himself to observe, and be convinced,
that his <span class="smcap lowercase">SADDLE</span>
is not fixed in an improper place,
but literally in the centre, equally free from the
<i>withers</i> as from the <i>hip-bones</i>; that his
<span class="smcap lowercase">GIRTHS</span> are
not only judiciously <i>tightened</i>, but that the buckles
extend on each side <i>above</i> the <span class="smcap lowercase">PAD</span>,
as well as that
the <span class="smcap lowercase">STIRRUP-LEATHERS</span>
are in too good a state to
hazard a chance of their <i>breaking</i>; whenever which
happens, in the very <i>heat</i> of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">CHASE</span>, great danger
(if not an accident) certainly ensues.</p>

<p>Thus safely seated, in the full confidence of his
own prudent precaution, he never suffers himself,
by the persuasions of the weak or inconsiderate, to
<span class="pagenum">{510}</span>
be diverted from his invariable purpose of proceeding
<span class="smcap lowercase">SLOWLY</span> to the place of meeting,
or throwing off the <span class="smcap lowercase">HOUNDS</span>;
he well knows, not only the
manly propriety, but the sporting necessity, of
letting a horse unload the carcase before he is
brought into brisk action or strong exertion. Upon
joining company in the field, he enters into little
or no conversation beyond the friendly salutations
of the morning; experimentally knowing, the <i>frivolities</i>
sported upon such occasions, by the young,
the confident, and the inexperienced, are only calculated
to excite the <i>silent curses</i> of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTSMAN</span>,
and the contempt of the company, by attracting the
attention of the <span class="smcap lowercase">HOUNDS</span>.
The judicious sportsman,
whether the hounds are <i>drawing</i> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">RUNNING</span>, is
never seen in a place to incur disgrace, by <i>heading</i>
the <span class="smcap lowercase">GAME</span>, or <i>obstructing</i>
the <span class="smcap lowercase">HOUNDS</span>; it is a business
in which he is a proficient, and he is never at
a loss in the execution. From an instinctive attachment
to the sport, and an implicit observance
of custom, he is totally insensible to the <i>less</i> attentive
part of the company, but "tremblingly alive"
to every <i>tongue</i> of a <span class="smcap lowercase">HOUND</span>.
Not a <i>whimper</i>, a
<i>challenge</i>, or <i>hit</i>, but vibrates upon his anxious
ear; and his whole soul seems absorbed in the
eager hope of transmitting the enlivening signal
of <span class="smcap lowercase">A VIEW</span> to his distant friends,
in equal expectation.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{511}</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap lowercase">CHASE</span> thus commenced,
he lays as well in with the hounds as the speed of his horse, and the
contingencies of the country, will permit; he stands
upon no paltry ceremony with, or servile subservience
to, local superiors; this alone is the happy
spot where all are equal, where personal pride can
assume no consequence, dignity can claim no precedence,
and an immensity of property is of no
avail. Ever attentive to the sport, he ruminates
upon no other object than the object of pursuit:
his mind is eternally intent upon the <span class="smcap lowercase">GAME</span>,
or the <i>leading hound</i>; the latter of which he makes it a
point never to <i>lose sight of</i>, unless by
<span class="smcap lowercase">COVERT</span> obscured
from his view; when, with the advantage of
the <span class="smcap lowercase">WIND</span>,
(which he is sure to avail himself of,)
and that unerring directory the <span class="smcap lowercase">EAR</span>,
he is <i>seldom</i> far from the hounds, or <i>ever</i> thrown out. In every
chase there are plenty of <i>slow goers</i> behind, who,
prompted by <span class="smcap lowercase">ENVY</span>,
are never wanting in the vociferous
exclamation of, "Hold hard!" without
knowing why; and from no other motive, than not
being themselves at the <i>head</i> of <i>the hounds</i>. To
these clamours he pays not the least attention, if
having viewed either the <span class="smcap lowercase">GAME</span>,
or the <i>leading</i> hound, and observed the chase going on without
interruption; experimentally convinced, those who
are the most <i>forward</i>, must best know the state of
the <span class="smcap lowercase">SCENT</span> by the <i>check</i>,
or breast-high running of the hounds.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{512}</div>

<p>As there is so frequently a jealous clamour about
being too <i>forward</i>, the zealous sportsman will never
condescend to be too far <i>behind</i>. He knows his
place, and he keeps it. He is never seen in the
<i>body</i> and <i>bustle</i> of the <i>crowd</i>, riding in a direct line
with, and pressing upon, the <span class="smcap lowercase">HEELS</span>
of the <span class="smcap lowercase">HOUNDS</span>,
but parallel with the last <i>two</i> or <i>three</i> couple of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">PACK</span>;
where his horse is not only enabled to keep
his ground with ease, but the rider enjoys the advantage
of observing most minutely every winding
of the chase, as well as the various struggles, and
enchanting emulative efforts, of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">LEADING HOUNDS</span>.
In this situation he is sure of seeing
where they <i>throw up</i>, and knows to a certainty how
far they have carried the <span class="smcap lowercase">SCENT</span>;
consequently those
only who are <span class="smcap lowercase">FORWARD</span>,
and know the state of the
chase, are properly <span class="smcap lowercase">QUALIFIED</span>
to give the signal of
"<i>Hold hard!</i>" to those <i>behind</i>; and not, as is too
commonly the case, for those behind to transmit
the petulant exclamation to those before. The
moment hounds are at fault, he invariably keeps a
proper distance, that they may not be obstructed in
making <i>their casts</i>, or get interspersed amongst the
<i>legs</i> of the <span class="smcap lowercase">HORSES</span>.
Upon a <i>hit</i> being made, he attends
to the hound who made it, and, upon a recovery
of the <span class="smcap lowercase">SCENT</span>,
goes instantaneously on with
the chase; for a loss of ground at so critical a
moment, he well knows it is sometimes difficult to
regain.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{513}</div>

<p>Notwithstanding his enthusiastic attachment to
the sport, the <span class="smcap">safety</span> of his
<span class="smcap lowercase">HORSE</span> preponderates
over every other consideration; and this inflexible
determination is supported by a few invariable
rules, which are never broken in upon under any
plea, persuasion, or perversion, whatever. No
temptation can induce him to deviate from a plan
so prudently adopted, and persevered in with such
laudable resolution. He is never seen to enter
into the <i>spirit</i> of <i>racing</i> during the
<span class="smcap lowercase">CHASE</span>, thereby
distressing his horse, and wasting the strength that
may be found necessary before the conclusion of a
<i>long day</i>: he scorns the idea of taking <i>high</i> or <i>large</i>
leaps when they are truly unnecessary, merely to
attract attention, or display his own
<span class="smcap lowercase">VALOUR</span>, well
knowing, "the better part of valour is discretion."
He regulates the speed of his horse by the nature
of the country he is engaged to go over, and
is never known to ride <i>hardest</i> in the <i>deepest</i> ground.
Experience, and attentive observation, having long
before convinced him, that whatever distance may
have been unavoidably lost under temporary obstacles,
may with less difficulty be recovered when the
horse's <span class="smcap lowercase">WIND</span>
(as well as his strength) is preserved,
till he can go more at his ease. Whatever may
have been the fate of the day, and whatever the
<i>length</i> of the <span class="smcap lowercase">CHASE</span>,
it is no sooner concluded,
than the same steady and cool deliberation with
which he started in the morning accompanies him
home: no rash or juvenile example induces him to
<span class="pagenum">{514}</span>
reduce the estimation of his <span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTER</span>
to the standard
of a <i>post-horse</i>; superior to the instability, and impatient
impetuosity, of the majority, he neither
<span class="smcap lowercase">TROTS</span> with <i>one</i>,
or <span class="smcap lowercase">GALLOPS</span> with the <i>other</i>; but,
regardless of the distance, humanely walks his
horse to the place of his destination, where he <i>sees</i>,
or <i>knows</i>, he undergoes the attentive comforts so
fully described under the last head.</p>

whose entire business it is to superintend every department
of a hunting establishment, as well as to
<span class="pagenum">{515}</span>
hunt the hounds. As it is an office of considerable
trust and responsibility, so it requires no inconsiderable
share of those qualifications which constitute
some part of the approach to human perfection. It
is indispensibly necessary he should be possessed of
a comprehensive mind, a clear head, and humane
heart; of affable and easy manners; not prone to
peevish petulance, or rude brutality. He should
be of consistent sobriety, ready observation, quick
conception, great personal fortitude, patience, and
activity; have a good constitution, an excellent
ear, and a sonorous voice. As, however, it may
not be inapplicable to have the necessary qualifications
more forcibly depicted from the very
words of the best experimental authority extant,
the opinion of <span class="smcap">Mr. Beckford</span>
is literally introduced, who says,</p>

</div>

<p>"I will endeavour to describe what a good
huntsman should be. He should be young, strong,
active, bold, and enterprising; fond of the diversion,
and indefatigable in the pursuit of it: he
should be sensible and good-tempered: he ought
also to be sober, exact, civil, and cleanly: he
should be a good groom, and an excellent horseman:
his voice should be strong and clear; and he
should have an eye so quick, as to perceive which
of his hounds carries the scent when all are running;
and should have so excellent an ear, as always to
distinguish the foremost hounds when he does not
<span class="pagenum">{516}</span>
see them. He should be quiet, patient, and without
conceit. Such are the excellencies which constitute
a good huntsman. He should not, however,
be too fond of displaying them, till necessity calls
them forth. He should let his hounds alone,
whilst they <i>can hunt</i>; and he should have genius to
assist them, <i>when they cannot</i>."</p>

<p>Although the qualifications of a
<span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTSMAN</span>, upon
the great scale of universality, should be precisely
the same, yet there is an infinite contrast in the various
points of execution. No distinct difference
of <i>light</i> and <i>shade</i> upon the
<span class="smcap lowercase">CANVAS</span>, no effect of
the <span class="smcap lowercase">ELEMENTS</span> upon the <i>human frame</i>,
can be productive of more opposite sensations, than the requisites
necessary to form a proper distinction between
the modes of hunting <span class="smcap lowercase">HARE</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">FOX</span>; for the very
means calculated for the successful promotion of the
one, would in a few minutes prove the evident destruction
of the other: from which it is natural to
infer, that a huntsman eminently qualified to hunt
<i>either</i>, would never be likely to acquire
<span class="smcap lowercase">CELEBRITY</span>
for hunting <i>both</i>; for as the accustomed spirit,
speed, and dashing impetuosity, of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">FOX-HUNTER</span>
would soon lose a <span class="smcap lowercase">HARE</span>,
so the philosophic patience, and constitutional tardiness, of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">HARE-HUNTER</span>
would never kill a <span class="smcap lowercase">FOX</span>.</p>

<p>Of this, corroborative proof may be adduced in
a subsequent passage from the before-mentioned
<span class="pagenum">{517}</span>
<span class="smcap lowercase">AUTHOR</span>,
where he observes, "It may be necessary
to unsay, now that I am turned hare-hunter again,
many things I have been saying as a fox-hunter;
as I hardly know any two things of the same genus
(if I may be allowed the expression) that differ so
entirely. What I said, in a former letter, about
the huntsman and whipper-in, is in the number.
As to the huntsman, he should not be young; I
should most certainly prefer one, as the French
call it, <i>d'une certain age</i>, as he is to be quiet and
patient: for patience he should be a very grizzle;
and the more quiet he is, the better. He should
have infinite perseverance; for a hare should never
be given up whilst it is possible to hunt her: she is
sure to stop, and therefore may always be recovered.
Were it usual to attend to the breed of
our huntsmen, as well as to that of our hounds, I
know no family that would furnish a better cross
than that of the <i>silent gentleman</i> mentioned by the
Spectator: a female of his line, crossed with a
knowing huntsman, would probably produce a perfect
hare-hunter."</p>

<p>The <i>scent</i> of the <span class="smcap lowercase">STAG</span>,
the <span class="smcap lowercase">FOX</span>,
and the <span class="smcap lowercase">HARE</span>, is
so exceedingly different in the duration of <i>each</i>,
that it requires a method as proportionally different
in the pursuit of <i>either</i>; all which is practically
known to huntsmen, who have no alternative, but
to render their endeavours applicable to the kind of
chase they are destined to pursue. The scent of
<span class="pagenum">{518}</span>
the <span class="smcap lowercase">FOX</span> is well known
to be the most powerful, as
well as the most <i>volatile</i>, of any; the scent of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">STAG</span> is equally
<i>grateful</i> to hounds, but is known to
evaporate sooner than the scent of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">HARE</span>. In
the two first, clamorous exultation <i>upon view</i>, is
more customary, and more to be justified, than in
the latter. <span class="smcap">Stag</span> or
<span class="smcap lowercase">FOX</span> breaks away with the most
undaunted fortitude, seeking safety in a rapidity of
flight to even a distant and unknown country; in
both which the hounds cannot be too fleet; nor can
they be laid on <i>too close</i> to the
<span class="smcap lowercase">GAME</span>; both deer and
fox run the better for it. Not so with the latter;
where a general silence should prevail, and the
industrious endeavours of the pack should never be
obstructed by the busy tongues of officious obtruders;
and upon this well-founded position, if
they receive no assistance, they encounter no interruption.
<span class="smcap">Harriers</span> (as well as their huntsman)
should never be permitted to hunt
<span class="smcap lowercase">FOX</span>: the strong
scent which he leaves, the difference of his running,
the indescribable eagerness and noise of the pursuit,
all contribute to spoil a harrier, and render no service
to the huntsman when they return to
<span class="smcap lowercase">HARE</span>
again. It is a very prevalent error of the present
time, to have bred and crossed harriers to too much
speed: the hare is but a mere inoffensive, timid animal,
and fully entitled to all the little artifices she
can avail herself of to shield her from destruction.</p>

<div class="pagenum">{519}</div>

<p>When found, she cannot be permitted to go off
too silently before the hounds; her own extreme
timidity frequently occasions her <i>heading</i>, and the
pack are as repeatedly liable to <i>over-run</i> the <i>scent</i>.
The huntsman, by not pressing <i>too close</i> upon the
hounds <i>himself</i>, will keep the company at a proper
distance also; and when they are thus left to a proper
and free use of their own faculties, they are
but little likely to over-run it much. The author
whose judgment and celebrity has been so frequently
mentioned, has something so applicable,
and so truly just, in every page upon this subject,
that it is impossible to resist the temptation of
quoting a few occasional passages, where the intentional
meaning is so emphatically and sportingly
exprest. He not only accords with every systematic
principle of the chase, but so constantly strengthens
his opinion with the embellishment of applicable
anecdote, that it is impossible to peruse his
"Thoughts" without both amusement and instruction.
He holds it a rule, "that hounds,
through the whole chase, should be left almost entirely
to themselves, and not be much hallooed:
when the hare doubles, they should hunt through
those doubles; nor is a hare hunted fairly when
hunted otherwise. They should follow her every
step she takes, as well over greasy fallows, as
through flocks of sheep; nor should they ever be
cast, but when nothing can be done without it."</p>

<div class="pagenum">{520}</div>

<p>Making every possible allowance for the diversities
of the different chases already alluded to, there are
leading rules characteristically annexed to the
<span class="smcap lowercase">OFFICIAL DEPARTMENT</span>
of the <span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTSMAN</span>, from which
hardly any possible circumstance can justify a deviation.
In addition to the invariable and indispensible
<i>duties</i> of the <span class="smcap lowercase">KENNEL</span>,
a strict and regular discipline
in the stables (so far as his own and the horses
of the whippers-in are concerned) should fall under
the eye of his inspection; by well knowing the
state of which, he best can tell of what work they
are capable. And this is the more necessary, because
it is impossible for him to relax from his <i>duty</i>
in the <i>field</i>: he is the
<span class="smcap lowercase">GENERAL OFFICER</span>, having the
supreme command, and whom <i>all</i> must obey. Persevere
and conquer, should be his motto in the
chase. <span class="smcap">Veni, vidi, vici</span>, at his return. This,
however, becomes more applicable to the spirit of
the huntsman whose good fortune it is to preside
over a fox-hunting establishment, where every
energetic nerve of emulative sensibility is so constantly
roused into action. How different from the
languid enjoyment, and frigid apathy, of what is
so admirably adapted to the opposite extremes of
youth and age! upon which no <i>two</i> opinions can
arise: the best authorities admit the <i>good find</i> of a
<span class="smcap lowercase">FOX</span> to be preferable to a
<i>bad run</i> with the <span class="smcap lowercase">HARE</span>.</p>

<p>From the moment of throwing off, as well as
during every progress of the chase, it is the peculiar
<span class="pagenum">{521}</span>
province of the <span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTSMAN</span>
to be at the <span class="smcap lowercase">HEAD</span> of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">HOUNDS</span>; once convinced of the
abilities of his subordinates, he has nothing to do with what is
going on <i>behind</i>. The place he should endeavour
to keep, when circumstances and unavoidable obstacles
do not occur to prevent it, is parallel with
the leading <span class="smcap lowercase">BODY</span> of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">HOUNDS</span>; in which commanding
situation he has unobstructed opportunity
to observe what hounds carry the scent; and if it
fails, to know to a certainty how far they brought
it: as well as ample scope for the exertion of his
proper authority, to prevent the horsemen pressing
too <i>eagerly</i> upon the <span class="smcap lowercase">HOUNDS</span>
(at a moment so truly
critical) by the emphatic injunction of "<i>Hold
hard</i>!" a signal that never can come with so much
propriety from any other voice as his own, nor
will it be so implicitly obeyed. A huntsman is naturally
anxious to obtain <i>blood</i>, not only to support
the reputation but the excellence of his hounds:
he should, however, avoid killing his game <i>unfairly</i>,
by lifting his hounds too much, or taking them from
<span class="smcap lowercase">CHASE</span> to <i>view</i>,
which is a most cruel, unfeeling,
and unsportsman-like practice. If the hounds
cannot kill by fair and equitable efforts, the object
of pursuit is justly entitled to its escape.</p>

<p>As in hare-hunting it is impossible to press on the
hounds too little, so in fox-hunting it is impossible
to press them on too much, at least while the scent
is good; that failing, much must be left to their
<span class="pagenum">{522}</span>
own industrious endeavours; those not soon succeeding,
the proper casts should be made with
judgment, and that without delay. Five minutes
lost in hesitation, frequently loses every promised
pleasure of the day. It is proverbially asserted,
that in a multitude of counsellors there is safety;
this is the very moment that proves an <i>exception</i> to
the <i>rule</i>; for, amidst the variety of obtruded opinions,
a huntsman should <i>think</i> before he <span class="smcap lowercase">ACTS</span>;
and once determined, abide by his <i>own</i> stability,
regardless of the frivolities with which he is so frequently
surrounded. If courage is thought a necessary
qualification in a huntsman, philosophic patience,
upon many occasions, is much more so;
for, whilst he sees a number of experienced sportsmen
in the field ready to assist his own judicious
exertions, he has the mortification to observe double
the number moving in a retrograde direction,
doing every thing but the thing they should do;
riding directly where they should not; probably
<i>heading</i> the <i>game</i> into
<span class="smcap lowercase">COVERT</span>, at the very moment
they ought to be standing still "as silent as the
grave." A proper degree of modesty, blended
with a little good sense and reflection, would soon
prevent those confident inconsiderates from such
glaring and absurd acts of indiscretion. It is a
maxim resulting from observation in the chase,
that those who do not seem anxious, and take
pains, to do <i>good</i>, are, as it were, habitually unfortunate
in doing the very reverse, and becoming
<span class="pagenum">{523}</span>
(perhaps undesignedly) the almost perpetual instruments
of <i>mischief</i>; and to this tribe of <i>misnamed</i>
sportsmen, a huntsman has in general the most unqualified
aversion; convinced that those who mean
to render him service, and prolong the sport, know
in what particular place they <i>ought to be</i> upon every
emergency; and if they are repeatedly elsewhere,
to where they should be, he soon knows how to
estimate their judgment in the field, and ability in
the chase.</p>

<p>The instant a huntsman observes his hounds come
to a check, is the moment when his assistance is
most wanting; then is the time to enjoin an equal
check and silence of the company; every <i>eye</i> and
every <i>ear</i> may be anxiously and inquisitively employed,
but not the sound of a tongue is necessary
upon the occasion. Those who are inclined to
<i>babble</i> in a moment of so much doubtful expectation,
lay claim to, and generally obtain, a most
<i>contemptuous sneer</i> from the
<span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTSMAN</span>, and not unfrequently
what is called a <i>blessing</i> into the <i>bargain</i>.
He should at no time be too ready to avail himself
of a <span class="smcap lowercase">HALLOO</span>
when hounds are at <i>fault</i>; they are
very often deceptive, and occasion disappointment;
exclusive of which, after they have been
taken from the spot to which they know they
brought the scent, they become less strenuous
in their endeavours, when they do not recover
it elsewhere, even where they were encouraged
<span class="pagenum">{524}</span>
to expect it. Boys keeping birds, as well as rustics,
from sympathetic enjoyment, frequently lead the
huntsman from his point. Mr. Beckford is therefore
of opinion, that when a doubt arises, it is
better for a whipper-in, or one of the company,
to ride forward, and inquire; it is only the loss of
a little time; whereas if you gallop away to a
<i>halloo</i>, and are obliged to return, the hounds become
very indifferent, and it is a chance if they
make another effort to recover the scent afterwards.</p>

<p>Not the least attention should be paid by a
<span class="smcap lowercase">HUNTSMAN</span>
to any halloo unless the hounds are at
<i>fault</i>; a huntsman taking his hounds from the
chase (when running with a good scent) to a halloo,
without much more than a <i>common</i> cause, ought to
be dismissed as a <i>fool</i> or a madman. Hounds are
sometimes hallooed too much, and too frequently
permitted to obey it; the consequence is, they are
no sooner at <i>fault</i> than they expect it: huntsmen
hurt their hounds by availing themselves of such
advantage, it makes them indifferent; they are always
upon the listen, become more and more slack,
particularly in <span class="smcap lowercase">COVERT</span>. So long as hounds can
<i>carry on</i> the scent, it must be admitted a very poor
and paradoxical practice to take <i>them off</i>; but
when, with all their fair and indefatigable exertions,
it cannot be recovered, it then becomes a
duty to render them every assistance. Cases sometimes
occur in opposition to every effort (particularly
<span class="pagenum">{525}</span>
in covert) where the leading hounds, in running,
get a head of the huntsman, and much before
the principal body of the pack; in such situation,
he must strenuously surmount intervening difficulties,
with all possible resolution, and get to them as
fast as he can, with what he can collect of the
<span class="smcap lowercase">PACK</span>,
and leave the remainder to be <i>hallooed forward</i>,
and brought along by the whipper-in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Huntsmen</span> who have too much <i>dash</i> themselves,
dash with so much rapidity in drawing from one
covert to another, that they frequently leave
hounds behind; and the whipper-in (where there is
but <i>one</i>, and there ought always to be <i>two</i>) being no
less eager than the huntsman to be forward, renders
what was an <i>error</i> in the <i>first</i> instance, a confirmed
fault in the next. It would be more sportsman-like
to get the hounds collected, and bring them
away all together; it might sometimes prevent the
return of a whipper-in for even a <i>single skirter</i>,
more particularly at the conclusion of the day,
when hounds are hallooed off for home. Left behind,
they become liable to loss as well as accident:
when once addicted to <i>skirting</i>, it becomes a growing
vice, and is seldom discontinued; they acquire
confidence in hunting by themselves, which they
never relinquish, and would rather dwell upon
their <i>own</i> tongue, than give proper credit to another:
in which persevering obstinacy they continue,
till the pack, drawn off, and evening coming
<span class="pagenum">{526}</span>
on, they are left to make their weary way through
a dreary country; or, exposed to the inclemency
of a winter's night, take up their lodging upon the
ground, with the additional chance of being attacked
and worried by every dog they see in exploring
their way the following morning.</p>

<p class="small">BEGS to make his most grateful Acknowledgements to those Noblemen
and Gentlemen, who have continued to honour him with their
Patronage during the <i>fourteen years</i> he has been energetically employed
in endeavouring to promote a Reform in the former <i>cruel</i> and <i>erroneous</i>
System of Farriery. It is the greatest ambition of his life to have
seen that endeavour fully accomplished. Since the original Publication
of his "<span class="smcap">Gentleman's Stable Directory</span>," he has exultingly
surveyed, not only the Institution, the Erection and the Establishment
of the <span class="smcap">Veterinary College</span>, but the almost incredible increase
of <span class="smcap">Veterinary Surgeons</span> in every Town; and <i>Veterinary
Druggists</i> in every Street of the Metropolis. Many of these, with a
certain degree of Professional Fertility, not only do him the <i>honour</i> to
imitate his long-established <span class="smcap">Horse Medicines</span>; but others, with a
degree of Liberality <i>peculiar</i> to <i>themselves</i>, offer to supply the Public
with "<i>cheap</i> and <i>efficacious</i>" Horse Medicines, for even <i>half</i> what
Mr. Taplin's <span class="smcap lowercase">GENUINE</span> Ingredients can be obtained at the first Commercial
Houses in the City of London. To the judicious and enlightened
this <i>Mystery</i> will sufficiently explain itself. Mr. Taplin, so
long honoured by the Countenance and Support of the most distinguished
and opulent Characters, never indulged a momentary Idea of dispensing
<i>Cheap</i> Medicines, because his Principles would never permit him to put
his Hand dishonourably into the Pockets of his best Friends; nor would
his well-known Attachment to the Animal, allow him to prepare a
single Article upon the genuine Property and expected probable Efficacy
of which, he is not only ready at all times to pledge his Reputation,
but his Existence. The honour of supplying near <i>six hundred</i>
Gentlemen, (a List of whom may be seen,) exclusive of his different
Agents, preclude the necessity of pestering the Public with perpetual
Advertisements; rendering it at the Commencement of every Season,
only necessary to communicate respectful Information, that Gentlemen

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
